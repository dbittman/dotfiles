T 1531795396 18<zgrep18>	That said, curl doesn't have that ability at all because it restricts itself to downloading the data, and not parsing the data (it does parse the headers, I think).

T 1531795481 18<nanovad18>	Thing is, I don't know how I'd get the data from the paste interface into the cgi script if the cgi script was doing the presenting and receiving of the POST.
T 1531795499 18<zgrep18>	Hm? It'd just upload to the same page with a POST request?

T 1531795786 18<zgrep18>	If it's encrypted on the server, the way it currently works, is that it saves it with the hash.
T 1531795789 18<zgrep18>	When you decrypt, the hash changes.
T 1531795796 18<zgrep18>	You'd get a new paste.

T 1531795874 18<zgrep18>	Why am I sending this in plain text to the server now?
T 1531795882 18<rain118>	It's best that encryption is done by the client. Not by the web browser or the server. That's why I proposed using a script that applies GPG then pastes

T 1568549879 <nortti>	the fact that you have mice dying seems to suggest that this is suboptimal, at least when thinking from e-waste perspective

T 1568550210 <john_cephalopoda>	I haven't actually bought that many Hama mice. Maybe 2 or 3 over all the years I've been using computers.
T 1568550348 <john_cephalopoda>	Maybe I got wrong price expecatations. When I can get a mouse that lasts an eternity for 20€, I assume that something like a Talon Blu, which cost 30€ or so at that time, would be of better quality and last some.
T 1568550664 <olsner>	why would you assume that?
T 1568550811 <john_cephalopoda>	Because the capitalist system teaches us that more expensive means more value.
