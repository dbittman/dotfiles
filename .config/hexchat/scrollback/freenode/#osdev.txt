On the Linux machine, it's a disaster: TOP indicates that only 1 to 5 cores work (instead of 48) while displaying in %CPU for the particular job rates of 4000% and in the end, it takes longer to do the calculation than if I limit it to 1 single thread (2 to 3 times longer then why.

T 1532279708 18<geist18>	it's easy though, since you generally enable paging, then start running C code. and reloading GDT/IDT/etc in C is easy, which is good because the C code will be thinking in terms of virtual addresses

T 1532279834 18<geist18>	on 32bit it can be a litle complicated, because in certain scenarios if you dont control the bootloader it could have put your code at a physical address that would be covered by the kernle virtual space

T 1532280747 18<graphitemaster18>	right, the only reason CPUs run slower when hot is because they contain circuitry and logic inside them to lower their clock speeds when things get too hot out of fear the chip may melt
T 1532280754 18<geist18>	since *usually* something running faster doesn't cause any problems, if it finishes before the next cycle early, no problem
T 1532280770 18<geist18>	yah. you *do* see it on mobile DRAM when in self refresh
T 1532280786 18<graphitemaster18>	if you removed that logic, they would probably run fine that hot for quite a awhile but their life would be severely reduced
T 1532280795 18<geist18>	many of the chips will draw less power when it's cooler because they have an internal thermistor that actually lowers the refresh rate based on temperature
T 1532280819 18<geist18>	so if you look at the power draw you can see it stair step down as it goes through temps
T 1532280863 18<graphitemaster18>	I feel like CPU companies treat people who OC as babies sometimes because you can't turn that off
T 1532280887 18<graphitemaster18>	it's like a hard limit on temperature before thermal throttle
T 1532280902 18<graphitemaster18>	so all cooling methods are about keeping it below that hard limit

T 1532299428 18<MrOnlineCoder18>	is it okay to use my pmm to allocate memory for paging structures like page tables or page directories instead of kernel heap?
T 1532299465 18<geist18>	yes
T 1532299472 18<geist18>	in fact you should absolutely do that
T 1532299503 18<MrOnlineCoder18>	just because it perfectly will fit my pmm paged-sized block, with kernel heap it would result in a plenty of work on the heap itself

T 1532299509 18<MrOnlineCoder18>	ok ty
T 1532299557 18<geist18>	yes, it'd be a waste because if it were a regular heap it'd have to be a) 4096 byte aligned and b) would have some little tracking structure before it
T 1532299575 18<geist18>	so you'd end up needing to functionally allocate 4100 or so bytes, and thus you need essentially 2 pages to allocate a page
T 1532299599 18<clever18>	and the page tables have to be aligned, so you may wind up with holes in the heap before and after the page
T 1532299605 18<geist18>	plus when allocating pages for the page tables you generally need to allocate from a very low level allocator like the pmm
T 1532299610 18<geist18>	so that you dont end up recursing
T 1532299618 18<clever18>	something designed to give entire pages will always be aligned and never have overhead from holes

T 1532299669 24*	zeus1 has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
T 1532299743 18<clever18>	something else i was just thinking about, with a 64bit kernel, its simpler to request a multi-page block from some kind of allocator, and have the paging tables setup to fragment it
T 1532299764 18<clever18>	so your physical free pages can be fragmented heavily, but you can still allocate large blocks via virtual memory in the kernel
T 1532299794 18<clever18>	with a 32bit kernel, its harder, since you have 1gig of virtual space for the kernel
T 1532299796 24*	Vulcan has quit (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
T 1532299811 18<geist18>	yah i do the linux trick where i just map all of physical memory into the kernel
T 1532299825 18<geist18>	which makes all of that trivial, since given a paddr you can trivially get the equivalent vaddr
T 1532299832 18<geist18>	and it's fast, since you can map it with 1GB pages
T 1532299835 18<heat18>	yeah
T 1532299838 18<clever18>	but you can only use that mapping if your allocating is contigious in physical
T 1532299845 18<heat18>	although kvm doesn't support 1gb
T 1532299848 18<geist18>	sure, but for page tables doesn't matter
T 1532299857 18<geist18>	heat: yah hence the 'can' part
T 1532299861 18<geist18>	otherwise i use 2MB pages
T 1532299872 18<geist18>	though on ARM64 it always has 1GB pages, so thats nice
T 1532299872 18<clever18>	this is also part of why zfs-on-linux has trouble on 32bit kernels
T 1532299879 18<Ameisen18>	geist - not sure if I'd need all of posix
T 1532299888 18<geist18>	yah, this is one of those if you go 64bit only your life is far simpler
T 1532299890 18<Ameisen18>	if I need legacy tools/such, I'd need to port those parts, I imagine.
T 1532299893 18<heat18>	I hate that because info tlb becomes a mess
T 1532299898 18<clever18>	the main read-cache is allocated in the linux heap using vm like i mentioned above
T 1532299902 18<clever18>	and it can very very easily exaust the 1gig of virtual address space
T 1532299903 18<geist18>	since you dont need a bunch of funny business to implement getting to physical pages
T 1532299915 18<heat18>	the read-cache?
T 1532299917 18<Ameisen18>	for instance, I dunno if GCC runs under Zircon
T 1532299919 18<Ameisen18>	I know it can build it
T 1532299928 18<geist18>	otherwise the general strategy i've used in the path is keap a 'hole' in kernel space, say 256MB, and have a get/put_page(paddr) api
T 1532299940 18<geist18>	it'll map it (probably using the 4MB page around it) and then keep it in a LRU
T 1532299942 18<clever18>	heat: zfs-on-linux uses the linux heap for its read cache, and that eats away at the kernel virtual memory mappings
T 1532299947 18<geist18>	with the idea that you generally will access things in patterns

T 1532300032 18<geist18>	i seem to remember that gcc bringup was fairly simple though, it was just a matter of not maintaining it, and no one wanting to add it to the general build since it'd take forever
T 1532300049 18<geist18>	i think clang/llvm is less simple, but probably doable
T 1532300059 18<heat18>	clever: isn't that a module?

T 1532300074 18<heat18>	right

T 1532300102 18<clever18>	heat: but zfs doesnt use the page cache, it has its own cache, with more advanced expiry rules
T 1532300109 18<heat18>	even shares memory between the block cache and page cache

T 1532300156 18<geist18>	this is probably in general why the memory overhead of zfs is known to be fairly high

T 1532300264 18<clever18>	geist: but it will dynamically release that when it detects the free memory going down
T 1532300266 18<CompanionCube18>	(also, back in 0.7.x they did a rather large refactoring of how it managed the ARC. Mostly because using virtual memory sucked butt.)
T 1532300278 18<clever18>	but i have seen large allocations like qemu fail, because it doesnt slowly grow the usage
T 1532300283 18<geist18>	right, that's what happens. trouble is if you have too many separate instances with their own logic like that
T 1532300294 18<geist18>	there isn't a centralized place to balance A vs B vs C
T 1532300299 18<heat18>	and since they can't/don't want to merge it to the tree, they'll be screwed

T 1532322385 18<geist18>	clang notably does not do that, at the expense of memory, since you can lose up to a page (or more depending on the arch) between segments, and it ends up padding out the binary as a result

T 1555878872 18<zid18>	yea scrolling with *just* a frontbuffer will be slow as shit
T 1555878877 18<zid18>	because you have to /read/ the frontbuffer to do it

T 1555878962 18<geist18>	reading back from the framebuffer is a huge dont do that
T 1555878983 18<geist18>	you should always render to it and leave it there. if you need to scroll you either re-render it from characters or you keep a back buffer
T 1555878983 18<stisl18>	ok, I will deactivate this and try this again
T 1555879001 18<geist18>	yah exactly 16fps is pretty darn good ifyou're scrolling that way
T 1555879022 18<stisl18>	lol
T 1555879024 18<zid18>	your scroll should be two memcpys, one from the backbuffer to the frontbuffer 'offset' by 1 row, then a 2nd copy for the 'new' row
T 1555879027 18<zid18>	not from front to front
T 1555879044 18<geist18>	right. it's probably only acceptably fast because it's using integrated memory for the framebuffer
T 1555879053 18<geist18>	if this were across a PCI link it'd be a lot worse
T 1555879147 18<stisl18>	ok, you helped me a lot
T 1555879185 18<geist18>	it does stand to reason that we should attempt to put this sort of non-obvious rules-of-the-road into the wiki or something
T 1555879284 18<zid18>	"don't read from 4 feet away to the gpu ddr to update your frontbuffer" seems.. obvious? :p
T 1555879486 18<geist18>	well, it's less so now that so many machines have stolen graphics memory
T 1555879504 18<geist18>	in embedded it's all over the place, it's fairly common to have the framebuffer on the other end of a slow link you have to manually update
T 1555879519 18<geist18>	theres no one solution, except on PC you usually have enough memory to back buffer at least once
T 1555879537 18<geist18>	and so there's a good reason to render and blit. even better if you keep a list of dirty regions so you dont have to blit the whole thing
T 1555879567 18<zid18>	just the one copy? :)
T 1555879572 18<zid18>	I should clearly have a bigger monitor
T 1555879576 18<zid18>	how big of a frame can I fit in 24GB
T 1555879720 18<geist18>	well if you have low level cotnrol of the framebuffer you can potentially scroll it and/or flip buffers to avoid any tears
T 1555879736 18<geist18>	that's usually fairly easy, but requires a specific driver (or maybe some sort of protected mode VESA thing)
T 1555879832 18<zid18>	yea I'd like if my vga console didn't tear
T 1555879836 18<clever18>	android's surface flinger will allocate a framebuffer 2x as high as it needs to be
T 1555879846 18<clever18>	and change the offset, to scroll between the 2 halves
T 1555879852 18<clever18>	to implement pageflipping
T 1555879866 18<zid18>	If you have multiple blacks you can do monochrome double buffering without flipping
T 1555879868 18<zid18>	which is pretty fun
T 1555879874 18<clever18>	then if you have a vsync callback, you can just swap at the right time for tear-free updates
T 1555879909 18<clever18>	zid: oh, that reminds me, one of the old sega consoles got higher fps, by changing the 16 color pallet

T 1555920088 18<stisl18>	hi
T 1555920105 18<stisl18>	is the APIC timer good enough for a real time scheduler?
T 1555920130 18<stisl18>	or should I better take ioapic
T 1555920186 18<bcos_18>	Of all the timers; local APIC timer has the lowest overhead and is the most precise
T 1555920215 18<bcos_18>	(especially in "TSC deadline mode", but also when not using that)
T 1555920262 18<stisl18>	The interrupt is only called once, I just wonder why
T 1555920277 18<stisl18>	I have set it to periodically
T 1555920319 18<bcos_18>	For local APIC timer? Do you send EOI?
T 1555920332 18<stisl18>	yes
T 1555920430 18<stisl18>	should I call eoi in the very beginning?
T 1555920432 18<bcos_18>	If you send EOI correctly (e.g. there's no bug with that); then the only other problem could be IF in eflags
T 1555920471 18<stisl18>	which I can set with cli and sti?
T 1555920479 18<bcos_18>	Yes
T 1555920538 18<stisl18>	the pit timer is called continuously and I am doing nearly the same
T 1555920708 18<stisl18>	does anybody have some example code?
T 1555920846 18<bcos_18>	There's only 5 possibilities: local APIC timer not setup how you think (e.g. one shot mode), task priority register changed after 1st IRQ, IF in eflags set after 1st IRQ, no EOI after first IRQ, or CPU crashes (locks up, reboots, ..) after first IRQ
T 1555920878 18<stisl18>	cpu crashes not
T 1555920887 18<stisl18>	the background routine is running
T 1555920920 18<bcos_18>	Could poll the local APIC timer count - see if it's decreasing to zero (or stuck at zero after 1st IRQ)
T 1555920938 18<stisl18>	ah, thats a good idea
T 1555921253 18<stisl18>	can I read the timer value with apic_read(APIC_LVTT);?

T 1555980950 18<ZombieChicken18>	being able to say "I need line 20 of file 'foo'" results in /just/ line 20 of file 'foo', instead of all of 'foo', and the programmer needing to find line 20 theirself

T 1568140463 <dfin>	hi. Is it fair to say that the structure of early TCP/IP-stack implementations mirrored the OSI-layers of the protocol, while optimized implementations are harder to understand as they violate the principle of separation of concern in this regard to some extent?
T 1568140593 <zid>	sounds reasonable
T 1568140598 <zid>	it's not an absolute truth of course
T 1568140655 <geist>	yah i'd agree with that
T 1568140663 <geist>	modern stacks violate the layering quite a bit
T 1568140689 <geist>	even tcp/ip itself violates it a tiny bit with their calculation of checksums operating on a pseudo header from the layer below
T 1568140694 <geist>	IIRC
T 1568140890 <18dbittman>	not only that; ARP can be thought of as a violation of the OSI theoretical model too.
T 1568140910 <zid>	arp is dumb in general
T 1568141002 <geist>	yah i thin that's the biggest violation in layering right now that i can think of. the fact that to be efficient the high level tcp/udp socket structure really needs to track the entire path all the way down so that it can more efficiently put together the packet causes things to blur a bit

T 1568143713 <geist>	huh haven't been following it, but pretty much all of the modern powerpc and ppc64 stuff has gone full little endian
T 1568143736 <geist>	didn't realize it. IBM basically switched all of their linux ppc64 stuff to LE and most of the big distros dropped BE support
T 1568143757 <j`ey>	SBCL supports ppc64el too now!
T 1568143768 <geist>	also fun fact: apparently most older ppc32s supposed bi-endian mode, but G5 (PPC 970, based on POWER4) doesn't
T 1568143785 <geist>	the POWER cores from what i understand only really picked up bi endian mode in POWER8
T 1568143793 <geist>	unconfirmed, just read in a few places
T 1568143854 <geist>	similarly seems that most distros dropped support for ppc32 altogether, either mode
T 1568143912 22✽	22jjuran pours 16777216 out for big-endian
T 1568143934 <18dbittman>	haha
T 1568143956 <geist>	nice
T 1568144027 <geist>	even debian dropped ppc32, only support ppc64el and have LE versions of mips
T 1568144033 <bcos_>	Next step is to attack networking ("localhost = 1.0.0.127"!)
T 1568144057 <geist>	looks like they still have a mips port though, presumably be since there's also a mipsel port
T 1568144082 <geist>	being that riscv is also LE, i guess that means BE is effectively dead for anything but embedded network processors
T 1568144205 <geist>	as someone pointed out somewhere on the internets, the real forcing function are GPU and graphics hardware

T 1568196642 <bytefire>	hi, in an os kernel, if somehow (e.g. due to a bug), there is a page table mapping that translates to a physical addess that doesn't exist on the platform that the kernel is runnin on, what happens when that address is dereferenced?
T 1568196684 <bcos_>	Probably nothing (you'd just read an unknown or default value)
T 1568196709 <bcos_>	..for 80x86; typically you get 0xFF bytes
T 1568196883 <Mutabah>	or you might get a machine-check exception, it really depends
T 1568197046 <lava>	yes
T 1568197051 <lava>	i would expect an MCE
T 1568197096 <lava>	you shouldn't assume that your OS continues running after doing that
T 1568197122 <bcos_>	I'd expect memory controller to decide "not RAM" and forward to PCI; and I think it might actually be part of PCI specs to return 0xFF to abort the transaction
T 1568197161 <bcos_>	MCE (if enabled) is mostly hardware failures (not so much hardware working right)
T 1568197171 <lava>	bcos_: certainly not for all addresses
T 1568197203 <lava>	you can lookup what the physical address space looks like

T 1568197263 <bcos_>	..like, if you accidentally hit a PCI device register then there's no way to guess what the consequences would be
T 1568197675 <bytefire>	thanks. assuming there is nothing at that physical address and OS gets some kind of bus error back, the OS should continue?
T 1568197699 <lava>	yes
T 1568197704 <lava>	@bcos_ i agree
T 1568197749 <lava>	@bytefire depends on how you set up your OS you might be able to catch a fault that occurs... in other cases the system might just halt or reboot
T 1568197762 <lava>	i've seen all of these across different architectures...
T 1568197788 <bytefire>	lava: interesting. why would system halt or reboot?

T 1568197979 <bytefire>	lava: actually i agree to a reboot but struggling to find reasons in its favour. mapping to a non-existent physicall address is a non-trivial kernel bug. continuing with that bug might be worse than reboot
T 1568197997 <bytefire>	are there any examples of systems which reboot on such an error?

T 1568341907 22✽	22geist has been digging into ARM external debugging port all day
T 1568341916 <geist>	looks like it's fairly straightforward to use one core to debug another
T 1568341925 <zid>	that sounds dirty
T 1568341954 <geist>	i'd been putting off reading how this stuff works for years, but once you get to it its pretty clever
T 1568341973 <geist>	the most clever part is there is no direct access to inspect the internal state of the core, but you can halt it and then shove one instruction at a time into it
T 1568341997 <geist>	and there's an easy place to write a word of data back to the thing doing the debugging (another processor or JTAG)
T 1568342007 <zid>	inject a bunch of mov [0xDEADBEEF], reg?
T 1568342011 <geist>	so basically you can dump the state of the core by shoving a series of instructions that just copy the value out
T 1568342016 <geist>	basically
T 1568342065 <geist>	so given that you can do pretty much anything you can think of to it
T 1568342110 <geist>	there are also a few priviledge instructions you can run only while being debugged, like an instruction that lets you directly set the processor mode (EL0, EL1, etc)
T 1568342131 <geist>	so if you break into a processor in user mode (EL0) you can just directly bump it to supervisor (EL1) and start going to town
T 1568342172 <geist>	since all the control registers that JTAG can see is also MMIO mapped, you can use one processor to do this to another
T 1568342195 <klange>	so you can check yourself before you wreck yourself?
T 1568342236 <geist>	well you can check your other doppleganger self before it trashes the place yeah
T 1568342250 <zid>	can you do multi-core drifting
T 1568342254 <geist>	or more importantly if it seems like the other core has gone off into the weeds you can trap into it and see what its doing
T 1568342284 <klange>	hm, I wonder if someone with split-brain syndrome could use one of their brain to debug the other half...
T 1568342286 <geist>	for better or worse there's no equivalent to double fault or triple fault on arm cores, they just keep running even if you put them in a bad place
T 1568342298 <geist>	so sometimes it's nice to be able to break it and see whats going on
T 1568342309 <klange>	just keep swimming~ just keep swimming~
T 1568342363 <geist>	pretty much, a arm core in a bad place usually is either stomping all over memory, running a bunch of garbage, or stuck in some sort of exception loop where it cant make forward progress
T 1568342391 <zid>	what are 00000000 and ffffffff to an arm cpu
T 1568342403 <zid>	for intel one is like add al, [bx+cx] or something odd right

T 1568342422 <geist>	depends on the instruction set.... i forget arm but unforunately they're not nop or bkpt
T 1568342427 <geist>	though may be bkpt which would be nice
T 1568342434 <zid>	it'd be brilliant if 00000000 was 'increment pointer and write a 0 to it'
T 1568342443 <zid>	so every time you execute zeros it just zeros all  your memory
T 1568342450 <geist>	i think riscv specifically went out of its way to make sure 0 is something destructive
T 1568342541 <geist>	ah, looks like arm64 treats 0 as explicitly undefined. so yay for them
T 1568342589 <geist>	or at least the entire top 16 bits being 0 is UDF, and the bottom 16 bits are unused, so you can encide up to 16 bits of UDF
T 1568342603 <zid>	now do all 1s
T 1568342619 <zid>	which is fairly common for unmapped memory or unprogramed eeproms etc

T 1568355734 <scapegoat0>	Good enough?
T 1568355743 <Mutabah>	A little too suck-up-y :)
T 1568355752 <Mutabah>	To answer your question, the difference is mostly semantics...
T 1568355775 <scapegoat0>	Difference between any two thing is semantics
T 1568355787 <Mutabah>	A bootsector is the first sector of a volume (which might be the start of a physical disk, or of a logical volume)
T 1568355830 <scapegoat0>	MBR is always start of a physical disk right?
T 1568355840 <Mutabah>	MBR is the term given to the first sector of a legacy hard disk, that contains both a small bootloader (that loads a bootsector from a partition) AND contains the partition table
T 1568355841 <clever>	i remember something about the old dos days, where the stub in sector 0 of the drive, would look at the partition table, and load+execute sector 0 of the PARTITION that is flagged as the boot partition
T 1568355893 <clever>	with modern bootloaders such as grub, there is a stage1 binary in the MBR, which loads stage 1.5 from a pre-defined location, and just ignores the partition table entirely
T 1568355920 <scapegoat0>	Cool thanks
T 1568355955 <clever>	grub-install is responsible for reading the partition tables, putting 1.5 at the right offset, and then modifying stage1 to contain that offset, and puttint it into the MBR
T 1568355982 <bcos_>	scapegoat0: For partitioned disks; "MBR" (in 1st sector of disk) typically contains some kind of boot manager that decides what to boot, and "VBR" (in 1st sector of partition) is the start of the operating system's boot stuff
T 1568356038 <bcos_>	(note that, for this case, MBR has nothing to do with any OS at all, unless it was a "single OS only" thing the OS installed for end-user convenience)
T 1568356115 <bcos_>	(also, things like GRUB try to combine "boot manager in MBR" with "boot laoder for many different operating systems that work in very different ways"; which mostly means it's a horrendeous design disaster)
T 1568356137 <scapegoat0>	Shit, I'll never be able to write a goddamn bootloader. I have been trying for 2 years now.
T 1568356163 <bcos_>	(like, "seperation of concerns" is totally ignored, and you end up with things like updating one OS and breaking every other OS)
T 1568356172 <clever>	i think grub can also install stage1 into the VBR, but that requires the filesystem to have enough empty space in its headers to allow it, and then an MBR to chain-load the VBR
T 1568356237 <bcos_>	Yeah; in theory it'd be possible to use one copy of GRUB as "boot manager only" to chainload other seperate copies of GRUB (on per OS, in the OS's own partition/s); but in that case you end up with a massive amount of unused bloat everywhere
T 1568356276 <clever>	the 3 main phases of grub, are stage 1, 1.5, and 2
T 1568356292 <clever>	stage 1 is typically under 512 bytes, and can only load stage 1.5 from a fixed position
T 1568356316 <ybyourmom>	u need an electric stone to evolve from stage 1.5 to 2
T 1568356322 <clever>	stage 1.5 is about 50-70kb-ish, and contains the main kernel for grub, and the modules for whatever fs /boot is on
T 1568356344 <clever>	stage 2 is then held in a file on /boot/, and implements the core of the UI and functionality
T 1568356370 <scapegoat0>	what the fuck guys, calm down
T 1568356376 <clever>	grub-install is responsible for figuring out the modules, and assembling stage 1.5

T 1568356464 <scapegoat0>	yeah sorry, in my country we don't care about the language
T 1568356547 <bcos_>	Anyway; just write a UEFI boot loader, let UEFI do the "boot manager" part, and don't worry about porting 6 mountains of Unix stuff so that your OS can run "grub-install" one day maybe ;-)
T 1568356574 <scapegoat0>	Isn't it easier to load a hello world kernel with an MBR bootloader?

T 1568356593 <clever>	with efi, you can just make your entire kernel a single efi binary, and let the bios load the file for you
T 1568356605 <clever>	you can just skip the whole bootloader mess
T 1568356627 <bcos_>	scapegoat0: Nobody just writes "hello world" - as soon as that works they want device drivers and encrypted file systems and animated ponies
T 1568356731 <ybyourmom>	Usually they want to move right into the difficult stuff too
T 1568356733 <ybyourmom>	like the GDT
T 1568356763 <ybyourmom>	GDT and IDT, usually are the long term projects most folks tend to get stuck on

T 1568408537 <griddle>	So in my kernel, I got low/high kernel virtual memory working. One the high memory is bootstrapped I want to remove the virtual mapping in low memory so processes can live there. But when I do `pml4[0] = 0` (clearing the first page mapping) I crash QEMU
T 1568408574 <mrvn>	crash?
T 1568408584 <griddle>	well, an assertion fails
T 1568408595 <griddle>	`cpus.c:1748:qemu_tcg_cpu_thread_fn: assertion failed: (cpu->halted)`
T 1568408627 <mrvn>	wow. Start writing a bug report.
T 1568408643 <geist>	i'm gonna guess that's a secondary effect of what apready happened
T 1568408662 <geist>	ie, it caused the cpu to crash in an exotic way that causes it to trip an internal exception
T 1568408663 <mrvn>	No matter what a kernel does should not crash qemu
T 1568408674 <geist>	like, say for example, you have the GDT or IDT still in the low area
T 1568408706 <griddle>	my GDT and IDT are all in virtual memory (above -23tb)
T 1568408706 <mrvn>	griddle: do you have debug turned on? It should tell you if it throws an exception
T 1568408707 <geist>	oh totally, but the assert is not likely the main problem as much as it's a symptom of an existing problem
T 1568408711 <griddle>	it doesnt crash in kvm,
T 1568408714 <geist>	yah i'd start with -d int

T 1568408733 <geist>	dig through the firehose and see why it gets there
T 1568408745 <geist>	well, none of us know the answer, all we can do is try to help you debug it
T 1568408763 <geist>	it obviously shouldn't do that, but that doesn't change the fact that you need to figure out how it got that way
T 1568408772 <griddle>	wow that is a massive firehose of information
T 1568408777 <mrvn>	The initial cause is pretty surely that you are still using something in lower half
T 1568408779 <geist>	also looking through qemu source where it crashes might be interesting
T 1568408809 <mrvn>	griddle: and you should put your kernel above -2GB.
T 1568408809 <geist>	yah the massive firehose is pretty useful when the very last thign yo do is fatal, since you can really just look at the last little bit
T 1568408877 <griddle>	the kernel is 64bit, why -2gb?
T 1568408891 <geist>	yes, but what mcmodel are you compiling it with?

T 1568408899 <geist>	there are limitations to particular mcmodels, sadly
T 1568408909 <geist>	oh. a) dont use large, it's really really inefficient and maybe buggy
T 1568408927 <geist>	if you use mcmodel=kernel then you're limited to -2GB to 0
T 1568408938 <geist>	but, there are some other models that are less inefficient (though i may be thinking of huge)

T 1568408992 <geist>	anyway, first things first, debug why unmappinmg the low bits causes it to go off in the weeds
T 1568409013 <geist>	it's also possible the assert causes qemu to lose the last part of stdio sadly and truncate the trace, i've seen that in the past
T 1568409025 <mrvn>	griddle: the opcodes can hold a signed 32bit as address. So having stuff betweeh -2gb and 2GB can acces stuff directly without having to load the address in a 64bit register first.
T 1568409050 <geist>	also it generates really inefficient references to its own data segment, since large assumes that the binary can be gigantic
T 1568409054 <mrvn>	griddle: shouldn't assert flush()?
T 1568409058 <mrvn>	geist: ^^
T 1568409070 <geist>	mrvn: i think so, but it doesn't necessarily fflush(stderr)? depends on what flush does

T 1568409338 <geist>	yah, none of the things will make any sense to us because you have to resolve all those addresses (specifically where the RIP is and whatnot) against the disassembly if your kernel
T 1568409355 <geist>	but specifcally i'd start by seeing where in the kernel that last few blocks of code are
T 1568409376 <geist>	if they're just the instructions leading up to pml4[0] being written then it doesn't tell us a lot more
T 1568409391 <geist>	but if whats actually happening is the cpu then crashes and goes off into some bad state, *then* asserts
T 1568409399 <geist>	then the trace will tell you why your pml4 thing causes it to crash
T 1568409444 <geist>	what's interesting about that trace is the first two blocks are in 32bit code, then the last one is 64bit
T 1568409461 <geist>	so there's not a lot going on there
T 1568409467 <geist>	unless it's actually rebooting and crashing a secnod time

T 1568409516 <griddle>	hmm, so probably a triple fault then?
T 1568409529 <geist>	no clue at all, yuou'l have to resolve that stuff against your code

T 1568410266 <geist>	yah pretty much all data structures are linear virtual except paging stuff itself
T 1568410289 <geist>	think of the paging unit as being essentially external to the cpu. it acts almost purely as a filter for the address lines once they've gone through everything else

T 1568410298 <zid>	gdt etc being linear addresses always seemed odd to me
T 1568410310 <geist>	i dont think so at all, it makes sense to me
T 1568410332 <geist>	also double so since in that era (80s) a lot of paging mmus were literally external chips that sit between the cpu and the bus
T 1568410350 <zid>	maybe there's just some thing I've not thought of
T 1568410371 <zid>	but it just seems weird that you'd involve paging etc potentially needlessly for important cpu datastructures, and all the fault handling that has to come with that

T 1568410399 <geist>	it's simply how it's done, and most paging mmus i've seen on similar architectures worked the same way
T 1568410425 <griddle>	i still am not sure why you cant do physical addressing in long mode
T 1568410430 <geist>	really the fact that x86 has two levels of translation is the weirder part, which makes it more odd
T 1568410444 <geist>	griddle: because the feature doesn't exist on x86, even prior to long mode
T 1568410478 <griddle>	well yeah, but I've also heard that it would over-complicate chip design
T 1568410504 <geist>	note there were some cpus (mips, vax, etc) that *do* have a physical addressing mode
T 1568410519 <geist>	but that usually involves carving up the virtual address space (32bits) into smaller fixed sized chunks

T 1568563375 <bcos>	..every time anything calls "get_ascii_char()" it calls "poll_keyboard_input" which does the "inb (0x60)", etc
T 1568563385 <xSlendiX>	yes
T 1568563424 <bcos>	So, it's polling and the IRQ in "irqc.c" just makes that worse
T 1568563451 <bcos>	..in a "lets interrupt the code that's already polling the keyboard, to get the keypress that we're probably too late to get" way
T 1568563453 <adu>	aren't you supposed to include some kind of repeat frequency or something
T 1568563468 <xSlendiX>	how?
T 1568563484 <adu>	by checking how much time has passed since key down?
T 1568563493 <bcos>	Mostly; the "get_ascii_char()" function needs to wait for the keyboard's IRQ handler to get a keypress and put it into a buffer
T 1568563539 <bcos>	..so it's like "while(buffer_empty) { hlt(); }" and never calls "poll_keyboard_input()" at all
T 1568563568 <bcos>	adu: For most scancode sets, the keyboard does the "key repeat" for you
T 1568563616 <bcos>	(of course you can ignore the repeats, and emulate it in software instead if you want better frequency control)
T 1568563646 <xSlendiX>	how could i get the keycode without inb(0x60);
T 1568563680 <xSlendiX>	that's the only way ik
T 1568563815 <xSlendiX>	poll_keyboard_input isn't polling
T 1568563854 <zid>	"in" is polling
T 1568563860 <bcos>	The IRQ handlers calls "poll_keyboard_input" (which uses "inb(0x60)") and shoves the keypress into some kind of FIFO buffer. Then something else checks for keypresses in the FIFO buffer
T 1568563906 <bcos>	(of course "better" is to realise everything should be using some kind of "event" system, but I'm guessing you've got nothing to use for that)
T 1568563946 <bcos>	(e.g. keyboard IRQ handlers sends a message to something, causing it to unblock and get CPU time)

T 1568567812 <bcos>	For detecting key repeat; just use a 1-bit "pressed/released" flag for each key; clear the flag when the you get "break code", and do a "if(flag not already set) { its a new press and not a repeat }" when you get a "make code"
T 1568567873 <bcos>	..but this has nothing to do with intentional key repeat; it's polling (where reading from the controller's buffer when there's no data might be undefined, but always returns the last byte received)

T 1568569249 <bcos>	..and then your "get_ascii_char()" does "while(pos == oldPos) { hlt(); }" and then does "new_char = myBuffer[old_pos++]; if(old_pos > 1234) old_pos = 0;"
